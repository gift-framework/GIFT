RECURRENCE FORMULAE FOR SPECTRAL DETERMINANTS

Abstract. We develop a unified method to study spectral determinants for several different
manifolds, including spheres and hemispheres, and projective spaces. This is a direct consequence of an approach based on deriving recursion relations for the corresponding zeta functions,
which we are then able to solve explicitly. Apart from new applications such as hemispheres, we
also believe that the resulting formulae in the cases for which expressions for the determinant
were already known are simpler and easier to compute in general, when compared to those
resulting from other approaches.

1. Introduction
In the last few decades the problem of evaluating the determinant of the Laplace operator on
Riemannian manifolds has received considerable attention in the literature. These calculations
may be traced back to the work of Minakshisundaram and Pleijel [23], Seeley [30], and Ray and
Singer [28], and they are based on a regularization procedure via an associated zeta function.
Techniques related to zeta function regularization gained some momentum within the mathematical physics community after Dowker and Critchley’s [12], and Hawking’s [20] papers from
1976 and 1977, respectively, described possible applications to physics – for a more complete
historical account, see [13], for instance; see also [15].
Briefly, given an elliptic differential operator T defined on a compact manifold (with or without
boundary) with discrete spectrum λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . , where in the case without boundary we
leave out the zero eigenvalue, we define the spectral zeta function associated with T by
ζT,M (s) =

∞
X

(λk )−s ,

k=1

which converges on some half–plane ℜ(s) > µ. Under certain conditions, which will be satisfied
by the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a compact manifold M (with or without boundary), for
instance, the function ζT,M may be continued analytically to a meromorphic function on the
whole of the complex plane, while being analytic at zero. We now see that, if it were possible
to differentiate the original series with respect to s at zero we would obtain, formally,
′
ζT,M
(0) = −

∞
X

log (λk ) ,

k=1

and thus
′

e−ζT,M (0) =

∞
Y

λk .

(1.1)

k=1

Clearly this procedure is not justified as such, but it suggests that we may use the analytic
continuation of ζT,M to the whole complex plane as a meromorphic function to define the determinant of the operator T as
′

det(T, M ) := e−ζT,M (0) ,

(1.2)

where we now use the expression ζT,M to denote this meromorphic function. Also, whenever
there is no ambiguity, we will omit the operator both in the index of the zeta function and in
the determinant as in (1.2).
Formally, the above definition of det(T, M ) is the product of the nonzero eigenvalues of the
operator T acting on M , and is, in fact, a natural extension to the infinite dimensional setting
of a formula that is valid in finite dimensions. While this allows us to make sense of the infinite
product appearing in (1.1), the expression on the right-hand side of (1.2) will not, in general,
admit a straightforward evaluation. In spite of this, there are several manifolds where this has
been done, and for which the determinant has been calculated explicitly. One such example
which will be relevant for us are the n−spheres Sn with the standard metric, which have, in
fact, deserved the attention of many authors across a span of more than thirty years, beginning
with the work of Vardi in 1988 [33], and followed by several others such as Voros [34], Quine and
Choi [27], Kumagai [21], Quine, Heydari and Song [26], Choi and Srivastava [9, 10], Awonusika [1]
and Halji [17], with the last two papers dating from 2020.

As a first simple example, consider the case of the circle S1 , for which, leaving out the zero
eigenvalue, the spectrum is given by λ1,k = k 2 for k = 1, 2 . . . , with multiplicities m1k = 2. This
yields an associated zeta function given by
ζS1 (s) =

∞
X
2
k=1

k 2s

= 2ζ(2s),

where ζ(s) denotes the Riemann zeta function. Proceeding as described above and taking into
consideration that ζ ′ (0) = − 21 log(2π), we obtain det(∆, S1 ) = 4π 2 . It is possible to continue in
a similar way for higher-dimensional spheres, but not only do the resulting expressions become
more involved as n increases, it also becomes clear that in order to find a general formula it
will be necessary to make the dependence on the dimension more explicit – for illustration, see
the expressions for the determinant for dimensions up to 9, given in Corollary 2.9. This has
led the authors of the papers quoted above to try out different procedures to obtain closedform formulae valid for all n, with the first explicit results having been obtained by Quine and
Choi [27], and Kumagai [21]. Finally, we also note that spheres with the standard metric play
an important role as critical and extremal metrics for the determinant of the Laplacian among
certain classes of metrics [24, 25].
The purpose of the present paper is to provide a unified approach allowing us not only to
compute the determinant of Sn but also of other manifolds such as hemispheres and projective
spaces. This is based on shifting the original eigenvalue sequence in order to obtain a suitable
eigenvalue sequence leading to an appropriate zeta function to which we can then apply the
method developed by the first author for the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator [14],
namely, the derivation of a recursion formula for the new zeta function. This is then related to the
zeta function of the original problem using the techniques devised by Voros [34] – this part of the
process has some similarities with Choi’s paper [8], where a general formula for the determinant
in the odd-dimensional sphere is given. An important step in our method is an explicit formula
for the spectral zeta function associated with the shifted eigenvalue sequence (see Lemma 2.3),
obtained as a result of being able to determine the solutions of the recursion equations satisfied
by the zeta-function. To the best of our knowledge, the derivation of recursion formulae and the
solution of the corresponding equations in the context of spectral determinants had not been
used previously, although we could trace some examples of the derivation of recursion formulae
for partition functions to the work of Camporesi [7]. The recursions obtained also emphasize
the dependence of determinants on the dimension. This is a well-known feature, which has been
observed on several occasions in the literature – see, for instance [3, 14] for the determinant
of the Dirac operator on the n-dimensional sphere and the quantum harmonic oscillator in n
dimension, and [24] for extremal problems on spheres.
As a result of this process, we obtain explicit expressions for the determinant of the Laplacian
on even- and odd-dimensional spheres, which may be found in Theorems 2.7 and 2.8, respectively.
For further reference and comparison purposes, and apart from providing explicit expressions for
some low–dimensional spheres explicitly, we also compute the numerical values up to dimension
10 000, showing the first 100 in Table 2.
Due to the flexibility of our method, we are able to apply it to other eigenvalue sequences such
as those corresponding to hemispheres (with Dirichlet boundary conditions), and real projective
spaces, for instance. The latter case was studied recently in [19], but we believe the results for
hemispheres to be new – see [18] for a study of the analytic torsion in that case. The graphs
with the values of the determinants as a function of the dimension in all these cases may be seen

4

in Figures 1, 2, and 3, displaying in a very clear way the dependence of these values on whether
the dimension is even or odd. The behaviour observed in these graphs raises several questions
related to monotonicity, the precise asymptotic behaviour of the determinants in each case and,
on a more speculative side, whether the different limits observed in the only case considered
where the manifold has a boundary are a consequence of that fact.
Due to its nature, we believe this method to be applicable to other situations such as complex
and quaternionic projective spaces, and to hemispheres with Neumann boundary conditions,
among others. These also include the quantum harmonic oscillator, closely related to the Dirac
operator on spheres, which was studied in [14], and to which we return now to determine a
closed-form solution of the recursion formulae derived there for the corresponding zeta function.
The fact that in this case the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant in the dimension is
exponentially decreasing, while we expect the remaining cases analysed here to have an algebraic
behaviour, would indicate that our approach is not restricted to determinants with a specific
behaviour.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section we collect the necessary results
and describe the procedure using the case of the n−sphere as an example. In Section 3 we apply
our method to the other examples already mentioned above. Appendix A contains some useful
facts about central factorial numbers which are used throughout the paper, while in Appendix B
we provide some tables with numerical values for reference.

∂s . More important, this

new zeta function yields an associated determinant which is now possible to calculate in any
dimension, and from which the original determinant may then be retrieved.
2.2. Relating the determinants of ζSn (s) and ζSn (s, λn ): the method of Voros.
In 1987 Voros studied several functions associated with infinite increasing sequences of real
numbers [34]. This was later extended to the more general case of complex number sequences
by Quine, Heydari and Song [26]. Of particular relevance here are sequences formed by the
eigenvalues of elliptic operators, including the Laplacian, and one important issue is to know
when a certain sequence may be what is referred to in [26] as zeta regularizable, that is, when
the corresponding zeta function has a meromorphic continuation with at most simple poles, to
a right-half-plane containing the origin, and is analytic at the origin.
One possible way to address these issues, which was used in [34], uses techniques from analytic
number theory, including the analytical continuation of Mellin transforms and the Weierstrass
canonical product E(λ) associated with the sequence {λk }, defined by

where µ denotes the abscissa of (absolute) convergence of ζT,M , and the sum in the exponent is
considered to vanish when µ < 1.
In the following theorem we collect a result from [34, pp. 447] in an appropriate form to be
used by us in the sequel.
Theorem 2.1 (Voros [34]). Suppose that the sequence of eigenvalues {λk } associated with the

2.3. Recursions. We shall now introduce the crucial step underlying our approach. Following
Theorem A in [14], in which a two-term recursion formula in the dimension was derived for the
spectral determinant of the quantum harmonic oscillator, we show that a similar recursion may
also be obtained in our first example, i.e the Laplace operator on Sn . For this case, the zeta
function ζSn (s, λn ) defined in (2.2) takes the form

Even though {λn,k } is not the original eigenvalue sequence associated with the Laplacian on
Sn , its relevance should be clear by now. In the preceding section we presented a method due
to Voros by which we are able to relate the functional determinant of zeta functions associated
with different sequences, as long as these are only shifted by a constant. In fact we have that

The recursion in the preceding lemma will enable us to derive an explicit formula for ζSn (s, λn ),
specifically, a finite weighted sum of Riemann zeta functions ζ(s). The properties of such weights
are induced by the recursion and shall be dealt with in Appendix A. As mentioned in the
Introduction, this recursion clearly shows a dual behavior on the dimension.
2.4. Solution to the recursion: explicit expressions for ζSn (s, λn ). We are now able to
solve the recursion in Lemma 2.3 to obtain more manageable expressions for ζSn (s, λn ) in even
and odd dimensions separately.

From Theorem 2.4 we conclude that ζS2n+1 (s, λ2n+1 ) is defined for ℜ(s) > n + 12 and it can be
meromorphically continued to a function of the whole complex plane, since it depends uniquely
on the zeta function ζ(s), with exactly n poles at { 32 , 52 , . . . , 2n+1
2 }. Analogously, we conclude
that ζS2n (s, λ2n ) is defined for ℜ(s) > n and can be analytically continued to a meromorphic
function of the whole complex plane with exactly n poles at {1, 2, . . . , n}.
2.5. Recovering ζSn (s) and the determinant. We are now able to combine the expressions
obtained in Theorem 2.4 and Voros method, namely, Corollary 2.2, to obtain simple and efficiently computable expressions for the determinant of the Laplacian ∆ on the odd (S2n+1 ) and
even (S2n ) dimensional spheres separately.
In the following proposition we recall some properties of the Riemann and Hurwitz zeta
functions, ζ(s) and ζ(s, a), respectively, and of the Bernoulli numbers Bn , all of which are
well-known and may be found in [9, Chapter 2].

In Appendix B we provide the numerical values for determinants up to dimension 100 for
reference. However, the above formulae allow us to compute much higher dimensions and in
Figure 1 we show a graph with the values up to dimension 10000. The two distinct sets of points
correspond to even and odd dimensions.
2.6. Discrepancies in the numerical values in the literature. There are some discrepancies in the literature for the values of the determinant of the sphere, namely, between those
obtained by Kumagai [21] and Quine and Choi [27], and those obtained by Choi and Srivastava
in [9]. Commenting upon these discrepancies in [9, Section 5.5], Choi and Srivastava trace them
back to the values used for the coeffiients c−m in these papers, as the differences coincide with

some of the values of c−m used. They then suggest that the way in which these values are
calculated should be examined carefully. The formulae for these coefficients are originally given
in Voros [34, pp. 444] as in formula (2.5) above, and this is what we have used in this paper.
We believe that there is a misprint in the simplified formula given in [34, equation (3.3)], and
that the correct formula for positive m should read as
ζT,M (s)
.
s→m Γ(1 − s)

c−m = (−1)m lim

To see this, note that following the usual procedure using the Mellin transform of the partition
function associated with an eigenvaue sequence λk , namely,

also for 0 < Re(s) < µ, with the exception of the poles at the points s = −ik . Dividing now
both sides by Γ(1 − s) and using Euler’s reflection formula we obtain

3. Application to other examples
The spectra of the Laplacian on the n-dimensional hemisphere Sn+ with Dirichlet boundary
conditions, and on the n-dimensional real projective space RPn are well known [2, 4] and quite
similar, for geometrical reasons, to the spectra of spheres. This enables us to replicate the
previous steps for these examples and obtain the recursions, and explicit formulae for the zeta
functions and determinants which we indicate below. Since the proofs are analogous to those
for the sphere given above, except in the case of hemispheres for which the results are new,
we present them without proof. In addition, we also revisit the case of the quantum harmonic
oscillator, already studied in [14], but for which we now present an explicit expression for the
corresponding zeta function.
3.1. Hemispheres. The spectral determinant of hemispheres with Dirichlet boundary conditions has never, to the best of our knowledge, been analyzed in the literature before. We shall
now show how the method described in the previous section for the case of spheres may be applied in a similar way to this case. Except for the zero eigenvalue, the spectrum of the Laplacian
on the n−dimensional hemisphere with Dirichlet boundary conditions is, in fact, the same as
that on the n−dimensional sphere, namely, of the form k(k + n − 1), with k a positive integeer.
The difference between the two lies in the corresponding multiplicities which are now given by
!

RECURRENCE FORMULAE FOR SPECTRAL DETERMINANTS

where k ∈ N - see [2]. As in the sphere case, we apply a shift to the spectrum of λn and the
corresponding shifted zeta function is thus defined as

with the series being absolutely convergent for Re(s) > n. From this it is possible to derive a

For completeness, and since the results for hemispheres are new, we will provide some insight
into the proof in spite of its similarities with the case of spheres. We begin by obtaining the
recursion (3.1) and its solution ζSn+ (s, λn ), in terms of the Riemann zeta function as presented
in Theorem 3.2 and in total analogy with Sections 2.3 and 2.4. Then we leverage such expressions together with Voros method,
 namely Corollary 2.2, to obtain the associated determinant.
Namely, we obtain that det Sn+ satisfies the following identity.

As in the case of spheres, we give the first 100 numerical values in Appendix B, and show
the graphs of the first 10 000 values in Figure 2. Note that now the behavior for even and odd
dimensions is even more striking, in that the corresponding limits as the dimension grows are
different.

3.2. Real projective space. The case of the real projective space has recently been considered
by Hartmann and Spreafico in [18]. Since our approach is different and, above all, the results
obtained are given in a different form, we now indicate the main steps in the application of our
method for this case, leaving out the main part of the proofs, as they are similar to those done
above.

Furthermore,
ζH 1 (s) = (1 − 2−s ) ζ(s)
ζH 2 (s) = 2−s ζ(s − 1),
so that ζH n (s) may be determined for all n by successive applications of the recursion formula
above. Most of the study in [14] then followed along lines closer to a more classical complex
analytic line of approach to the study of zeta functions, without making use of these formulae.
However, the similarities with the identities given in Lemma 2.3 and the other cases considered
in this paper are striking, and, indeed, a similar approach is possible, allowing us to determine
an explicit formula for ζH n (s) – note that the study carried out in [14] was mostly concerned
with finding, in a rigorous way, the asymptotic behavior of the determinant as n became large.

Appendix A. Central factorial numbers and relevant properties
The Stirling numbers of the first kind, s(n, k) can be defined as the coefficients of the expansion
of the falling factorial polynomial of degree n, denoted [x]n
[x]0 = 1,

[x]n = x(x − 1) . . . (x − n + 1) =:

They have received a lot of attention and are at the core of the study of permutations, as s(n, k)
counts the number of permutations of n elements with k cycles. We shall only present here their
properties which are relevant for our purposes, and refer to [11, Chapter 5] for a more complete
treatment of these numbers.

RECURRENCE FORMULAE FOR SPECTRAL DETERMINANTS

We shall, however, make extensive use of central factorial numbers of the first kind t(n, k),
which have received less attention in the literature. They can be defined as the coefficients of
the expansion of the central factorial polynomial of degree n, denoted by x[n] .

A short introductory reference to central factorial numbers may be found in [29, pp. 213-217],
and we refer to [5] for a more systematic treatment, including their main properties and a
variety of applications. Although more closely related to the Stirling numbers of the first kind,
the central factorial numbers are also related to the Euler and Bernoulli numbers (see [6, 22]). In
this appendix, we shall summarize and introduce several properties which were used throughout
the paper.
The identities in the following proposition follow directly from the aforementioned definitions.
For more details we refer to [5, pp. 428, Propostion 2.1] with the exception of entry (vii) which
is given in [5, pp. 480, Propostion 7.3]. We remark the similarities between the recursion in
entry (i) and the recursion given for ζSn (s, λn ) in Lemma 2.3.
Proposition A.1. Let n ∈ N. The following identities hold.

It will be useful to consider the central factorial numbers with even and odd indices separately,
which is also justified by Proposition A.1 (vi). These are defined as
u(n, k) := t(2n, 2k)
n−k

v(n, k) := 4

t(2n − 1, 2k − 1)

(A.3)
(A.4)

Both of these integer sequences are present in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
(OEIS) under A008955 for u(n, k) and under A008956 for v(n, k). In Table 1 their values for
n, k = 0, . . . , 6 are given. We remark that sgn(s(n, k)) = sgn(v(n, k)) = sgn(u(n, k)) = (−1)n−k
for n, k ≥ 1 which follows straight from their respective definitions.

A.1. Central factorial numbers with even indices.
A detailed treatment of the central factorial numbers with even indices u(n, k) may be found
in Shiha [31], where a recurrence relation, generating function, distribution and general formula
are presented, together with several combinatorial identities and applications. For our purposes
we shall only need the following lemma which is also a direct consequence of definitions (A.2)

These are key to understanding the functional determinant of the Laplacian on odd-dimensional

shall be used several times.
Proposition A.3. Let n ∈ N. The following identities hold true:
