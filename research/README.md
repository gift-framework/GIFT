# Research

This folder contains **exploratory research** extending the GIFT framework to open problems in theoretical physics.

Unlike `publications/` (peer-reviewed quality) and `docs/` (stable documentation), content here represents **work in progress** with varying levels of validation.

## Current Research Areas

### [yang-mills/](./yang-mills/)

Investigation of the Yang-Mills mass gap problem through GIFT's geometric framework.

**Key finding**: The spectral gap on G₂-holonomy manifolds scales as λ₁ ∝ 1/H*, validated with R² = 0.96 across multiple manifold constructions.

**Status**: Exploratory — universal formula conjectured, not yet proven.

## Status Classifications

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **VALIDATED** | Independently verified (blind testing, multiple methods) |
| **CONJECTURED** | Proposed formula, awaiting broader verification |
| **EXPLORATORY** | Early investigation, results may change |
| **ARCHIVED** | Historical record, superseded by newer work |

## Contributing

Research in this folder should:
1. Clearly state validation status
2. Distinguish proven results from conjectures
3. Document methodology to enable reproduction
4. Reference relevant literature
