# Archive

**Cleaned up**: 2026-01-29

This folder contains dead ends, superseded versions, and exploratory documents that are no longer part of the active research.

## Contents

### notebooks/
Old Yang-Mills notebook versions (v1-v9) superseded by v10/v11:
- `G2_Universality_v7_Lock.ipynb`
- `G2_Universality_v8_Lock.ipynb`
- `G2_Quaternionic_Sampling_v5.ipynb`
- `G2_TCS_Sampling_v4.ipynb`
- `G2_TCS_Anisotropy_v3.ipynb`
- `Convergence_Study_V3_Publication.ipynb`
- And other exploratory notebooks

### metrics/
Superseded TCS metric implementations:
- `g2_metric.py` (v1) — Initial implementation
- `g2_metric_v2.py` (v2) — Intermediate version

Current version: `tcs/metric/g2_metric_final.py` (v3)

### spectral-exploratory/
32 exploratory documents from `spectral/` folder. The core conjecture is preserved in `spectral/PELL_TO_SPECTRUM.md`.

Archived docs include:
- K7_*.md — Various K7 construction attempts
- TIER2_*.md, TIER3_*.md — Tier decomposition explorations
- ANALYTICAL_*.md — Analytical approach drafts
- CALIBRATION_*.md — Calibration studies
- LEAN_*.md — Early Lean integration plans

## Why Archived?

1. **Notebooks**: v10/v11 incorporate all learnings from earlier versions
2. **Metrics**: v3 (`g2_metric_final.py`) has SPD guarantee, supersedes v1/v2
3. **Spectral docs**: 36 exploratory docs consolidated; only `PELL_TO_SPECTRUM.md` contains the core argument

## Retrieval

If you need something from the archive, it's still accessible here. The git history also preserves all previous states.
