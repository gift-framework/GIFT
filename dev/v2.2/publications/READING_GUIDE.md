## Key Concepts to Understand First

1. **E₈×E₈**: The gauge group (dimension 496) providing algebraic structure
2. **K₇**: The internal 7-dimensional manifold with G₂ holonomy
3. **Betti numbers**: b₂=21 (gauge), b₃=77 (matter) - determine field content
4. **Zero-parameter**: No continuous parameters adjusted to fit data
5. **PROVEN vs TOPOLOGICAL**: Exact proofs vs direct topological consequences
