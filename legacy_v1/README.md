# GIFT v1.0 - Legacy Archive

This directory serves as a reference point for the archived v1.0 version of the Geometric Information Field Theory framework.

## Version History

### v1.0.0 (Archived)
The initial version of the GIFT framework demonstrated the potential for deriving Standard Model parameters from E₈×E₈ geometric structure. While this version showed promising results, it has been superseded by v2.0.0 with substantial improvements.

### v2.0.0 (Current)
The current version represents a complete reorganization with:

- **Modular structure**: Main paper with six detailed mathematical supplements
- **Improved precision**: 0.13% mean deviation across 34 dimensionless observables
- **Rigorous proofs**: Complete mathematical derivations for exact relations
- **Enhanced documentation**: Comprehensive guides and experimental validation
- **Parameter reduction**: From 4 to 3 independent geometric parameters

## Accessing v1.0

The v1.0 codebase is preserved in the git history. To access previous versions:

```bash
# View commit history
git log --all --oneline

# Checkout a specific commit from v1.0 era
git checkout <commit-hash>

# Return to current version
git checkout main
```

## Migration to v2.0

If you were using v1.0, the key changes for migration:

1. **File structure**: Documents now organized in `publications/` with `supplements/` subdirectory
2. **Precision improvements**: Updated parameter values with higher accuracy
3. **New features**: Complete neutrino sector, cosmological predictions, rigorous proofs
4. **Documentation**: Expanded guides in `docs/` directory

## References

For current documentation, see:
- Main framework: `publications/gift_main.md`
- Mathematical foundations: `publications/supplements/A_math_foundations.md`
- Quick start guide: `QUICK_START.md`
- Repository structure: `STRUCTURE.md`

## Note

This archive directory exists primarily for reference. All active development occurs in the main repository structure. The v1.0 framework is not maintained and users should adopt v2.0 for current work.
