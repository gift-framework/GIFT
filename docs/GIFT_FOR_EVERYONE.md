# Introduction: What is K₇?

**K₇** (formerly Geometric Information Field Theory) proposes that the fundamental constants of physics (numbers like 1/137, the masses of particles, the strengths of forces) are not arbitrary. They emerge from the **shape** of hidden dimensions in the universe.

**The core idea in one sentence**: The universe has 7 hidden dimensions curled up in a specific shape called K₇, and the properties of this shape mathematically determine everything we measure.

**Why should you care?**

The Standard Model of physics has **19 free parameters**, numbers we measure but can't explain. Why is the electron 1836 times lighter than the proton? Why are there exactly 3 families of particles? Why is the fine structure constant 1/137?

K₇ proposes answers: **zero free parameters**. Everything comes from geometry.

# Part I: The Building Blocks

## Number Systems

### Real Numbers (ℝ)

**The fancy word**: Field of real numbers, dimension 1.

**The kitchen table version**: A ruler. The numbers we use every day: 1, 2, 3.14159..., -7, √2. You can place them on an infinite line.

**In K₇**: The basic brick. Everything else is built on top.

---

### Complex Numbers (ℂ)

**The fancy word**: Extension of reals with imaginary unit i² = -1, dimension 2.

**The kitchen table version**: A treasure map. With real numbers, you can only go left or right on a line. With complex numbers, you have a **2D map**: left/right AND up/down. The number "i" is simply "one step up." And i × i = -1 means "two steps up = turn around."

**Everyday use**: The electricity in your home uses complex numbers! Alternating current "rotates" like a needle on the map.

**In K₇**: Complex numbers describe the phases of quantum waves.

---

### Quaternions (ℍ)

**The fancy word**: 4-dimensional division algebra with three imaginary units i, j, k.

**The kitchen table version**: The video game controller. Want to rotate a 3D character in a game? Quaternions have **4 components** (1 real + 3 imaginary: i, j, k) that can describe any 3D rotation without "gimbal lock" (the bug where sometimes two axes merge).

**Fun fact**: Discovered in 1843 by Hamilton, who carved the formula i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1 on a bridge in Dublin!

**In K₇**: Intermediate step toward octonions. Shows that number systems "grow" by powers of 2.

---

### Octonions (𝕆)

**The fancy word**: 8-dimensional division algebra, non-associative.

**The kitchen table version**: The ULTIMATE Lego kit.

| System | Dimension | What you can do |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Reals | 1 | Measure a length |
| Complex | 2 | 2D rotations, electricity |
| Quaternions | 4 | 3D rotations, video games |
| **Octonions** | **8** | **Everything possible** |

After octonions, **there's nothing more**. Mathematically proven (Hurwitz theorem, 1898). It's the richest number system that exists.

**The weirdness**: Octonions are not "associative." (a × b) × c ≠ a × (b × c). It's as if the order you assembled your Legos changed the final result!

**In K₇**: The universe uses the most complete kit available. The 7 imaginary units of octonions give the 7 dimensions of K₇.

---

### Sedenions and Beyond

**The fancy word**: 16-dimensional algebra, but no longer a division algebra.

**The kitchen table version**: The defective Lego kit. You can keep doubling: 16, 32, 64... But starting at 16, the "Legos" no longer fit together properly. You can have pieces that, multiplied together, give zero even if neither is zero. It's broken.

**In K₇**: This explains why nature stops at octonions. No choice, it's the last "proper" algebra.

---

### The Fano Plane

**The fancy word**: The smallest finite projective plane, PG(2,2).

**The kitchen table version**: The perfect social network.

7 people, 7 WhatsApp groups:
- Each group has exactly 3 people
- Each person is in exactly 3 groups
- Any 2 people share exactly 1 group

It's the most "efficient" configuration possible. No redundancy, no gaps.

![The Fano plane: 7 points, 7 lines (the 3 sides of the triangle, the 3 medians, and the inscribed circle), each containing exactly 3 points.](figures/fig1_fano_plane.png)

**The magic trick**: This network has 168 ways to rearrange itself while keeping the same structure: the symmetry group called **PSL(2,7)**, of order 168. And here's the real twist: 168 ÷ 56 = **3**. Three particle families.

What's the 56? It's the dimension of E₇'s "fundamental representation" (the **smallest non-trivial way** the giant exceptional group E₇ can act on a vector space (we'll meet E₇ a few sections below). The Fano plane (small, finite, 7 points) and E₇ (huge, continuous, 133-dimensional) are linked across scales. Their ratio happens to be exactly the number of fermion generations we observe. K₇ says: that's not a coincidence) that's geometry talking to itself across dimensions.

**In K₇**: The Fano plane encodes octonion multiplication. It's the "times table" of the universe.

---

## Symmetry Groups

### What is a Group?

**The fancy word**: Set equipped with an associative operation, with identity element and inverses.

**The kitchen table version**: A club with rules.

A mathematical group is like a club where:
- There are **members** (the elements)
- Two members can **combine** to make a third (the operation)
- There's a member who **changes nothing** (the identity, like "0" for addition)
- Every member has an **opposite** that cancels it (the inverse)

**Simple example**: The rotations of a square form a group. You can rotate by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Two rotations combined = another rotation. The 0° rotation changes nothing. Each rotation has its inverse.

---

### U(1): The Circle Group

**The fancy word**: Unitary group of dimension 1, isomorphic to the circle.

**The kitchen table version**: The clock hand. U(1) is all the ways to point in a direction on a circle. The hand can be at noon, at 3 o'clock, at 7:42... it's a continuum of positions.

**In physics**: It's the symmetry group of **electromagnetism**. Changing the "phase" of a charged particle (like rotating the hand) doesn't change observable physics.

**In K₇**: U(1) naturally emerges from larger structures like E₈.

---

### SU(2): The Quantum Rotations Group

**The fancy word**: Special unitary group of dimension 2, double cover of SO(3).

**The kitchen table version**: The Möbius strip of rotations.

Imagine you spin around 360°. Normally, you're back where you started, right?

**Not in quantum mechanics!** You need to spin **720°** (two full turns) to truly return to the initial state. It's as if the universe counts half-turns.

SU(2) captures this weirdness: it has "twice as many" elements as ordinary rotations.

**In physics**: It's the group of the **weak force** (the one that causes radioactivity). It also describes electron **spin**.

**In K₇**: SU(2) is contained in G₂ and E₈.

---

### SU(3): The Color Group

**The fancy word**: Special unitary group of dimension 3, dimension 8.

**The kitchen table version**: The RGB paint mixer.

Quarks have a property called "color" (nothing to do with real colors, it's just a name). There are 3 colors: red, green, blue.

SU(3) describes all the ways to **mix these colors** together, like a sophisticated paint mixer that can turn red into green, green into blue, etc.

**In physics**: It's the group of the **strong force** (the one that glues quarks together). The 8 "gluons" correspond to the 8 dimensions of SU(3).

**In K₇**: dim(SU(3)) = 8 = dim(𝕆). Coincidence? K₇ says no.

---

### G₂: The Guardian of Octonions

**The fancy word**: Smallest exceptional Lie group, dimension 14, automorphisms of octonions.

**The kitchen table version**: The guardian of the octonions.

Imagine a crystal ball with patterns inside. G₂ is the set of all transformations that **preserve the structure of octonions**. It's like the set of ways to rearrange a Rubik's cube while keeping the rules of the game intact.

**Why 14?** Octonions have 7 imaginary units. The transformations preserving them form a 14-dimensional space. It's a mathematical fact, not a choice.

**The 5 exceptional groups**: G₂, F₄, E₆, E₇, E₈: these are the "outsiders" in the classification of Lie groups. They don't belong to any infinite family.

**In K₇**: G₂ is EVERYWHERE. dim(G₂) = 14 appears in Koide (14/21 = 2/3), in δ_CP (7×14+99), etc.

---

### F₄: The Intermediate Group

**The fancy word**: Exceptional Lie group of dimension 52.

**The kitchen table version**: The architect of the halfway house. F₄ is related to the "octonion plane" (the octonionic projective plane).

**In K₇**: dim(F₄) = 52 appears in scale bridge calculations.

---

### E₆: The Grand Unification Group

**The fancy word**: Exceptional Lie group of dimension 78.

**The kitchen table version**: The grandparent of symmetries.

E₆ contains SO(10) which contains SU(5) which contains U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3). It's like the great-grandparent of all Standard Model symmetries.

**Bonus**: E₆ has a 27-dimensional representation linked to the exceptional Jordan algebra.

**In K₇**: The Jordan algebra (dim 27) appears in m_μ/m_e = 27^φ.

---

### E₇: The Mystery Group

**The fancy word**: Exceptional Lie group of dimension 133.

**The kitchen table version**: The mysterious older brother. E₇ has a fundamental representation of dimension **56**. And 168/56 = 3!

**In K₇**: N_gen = |PSL(2,7)| / dim(fund(E₇)) = 168/56 = 3.

---

### E₈: The Titan of Symmetries

**The fancy word**: Largest exceptional Lie group, dimension 248.

**The kitchen table version**: The Versailles Palace of math.

E₈ is the most complex and beautiful symmetry group that exists. Its structure is so rich that:
- Its smallest representation already has **248 dimensions** (same as the group itself!)
- Its root diagram looks like a perfectly balanced 8-dimensional star
- It contains all other exceptional groups

**Fun fact**: In 2007, a team of 18 mathematicians took 4 years to completely calculate E₈'s structure. The result is 60 gigabytes!

**In K₇**: E₈ × E₈ (248 + 248 = 496 dimensions) is the fundamental symmetry group. 248 appears in m_τ/m_e = 7 + 10×248 + 10×99.

---

### The Weyl Group

**The fancy word**: Reflection group associated with a root system.

**The kitchen table version**: The symmetries of a kaleidoscope.

Imagine a kaleidoscope. The mirrors create multiple reflections, and certain mirror configurations create patterns that repeat regularly. The Weyl group is the set of these "reflections" for a given Lie group.

**For E₈**: The Weyl group has an astronomical order: 696,729,600.

**In K₇**: The "Weyl number" Weyl = 5 appears in various formulas.

---

# Part II: The Shape of the Universe

## Manifolds and Dimensions

### What is a Manifold?

**The fancy word**: Locally Euclidean topological space.

**The kitchen table version**: The surface of the Earth.

The Earth is round (a sphere), but when you walk around your neighborhood, it looks like a flat plane.

A manifold is the same: **globally** it can have a complicated shape, but **locally** (when you zoom in) it always looks like "normal" space.

- Surface of a ball = 2-dimensional manifold
- Space in your room = 3-dimensional manifold
- K₇ = 7-dimensional manifold

---

### Dimension

**The fancy word**: Number of independent coordinates needed to specify a point.

**The kitchen table version**: How many questions to find you?

- **1D** (line): "How many meters from the start?" → 1 question
- **2D** (map): "Latitude? Longitude?" → 2 questions
- **3D** (space): "Latitude? Longitude? Altitude?" → 3 questions
- **7D** (K₇): You need 7 numbers to say "where" you are

**In K₇**: The universe = 4D visible + 7D hidden = 11D total.

---

### Compact Manifold

**The fancy word**: Closed and bounded manifold.

**The kitchen table version**: An island vs the infinite ocean.

- **Non-compact**: The ocean stretches infinitely. You can swim forever without coming back.
- **Compact**: An island has edges (or is closed on itself like a sphere). You can't go infinitely far.

The surface of the Earth is compact: you can walk a long time, but you'll eventually return to your starting point.

**In K₇**: K₇ is compact: the 7 dimensions are "folded" on themselves, not infinite.

---

### Extra Dimensions

**The fancy word**: Compactified spatial dimensions beyond the observable 3+1.

**The kitchen table version**: The garden hose.

From far away, a garden hose looks like a line (1 dimension).

Up close, you see it's a tube: each point on the "line" is actually a little circle (1 + 1 = 2 dimensions).

The universe might be the same:
- From far away (our scale): 3 dimensions of space + 1 of time
- From very very close (Planck scale): 3+1 + **7 curled-up dimensions** = 11 total

The 7 curled-up dimensions have the shape of K₇.

**In K₇**: We don't "see" K₇, but its properties dictate the constants we measure.

---

### Calabi-Yau vs G₂ Manifolds

**The fancy word**: Compact Kähler manifold with vanishing first Chern class (Calabi-Yau) vs compact manifold with G₂ holonomy.

**The kitchen table version**: K₇'s cousins.

Calabi-Yau spaces are the "hidden shapes" used in traditional string theory. They have 6 dimensions (to make 10 total with 4 of spacetime).

**Problem**: There are BILLIONS of different ones (the famous 10^500 solution "landscape"). Which one to choose?

**In K₇**: K₇ (G₂ holonomy, 7 dimensions) is more constrained than Calabi-Yau (SU(3) holonomy, 6 dimensions). G₂ achieves 13× better precision than Calabi-Yau approaches.

---

## K₇: The Cosmic Diabolo

**The fancy word**: Compact 7-dimensional manifold with G₂ holonomy, constructed by "twisted connected sum."

**The kitchen table version**: The cosmic diabolo.

Imagine a diabolo (the juggling toy):
- Its **shape** determines how it spins
- The **string** controls its movement
- The **balance** depends on all of that

K₇ is a "7-dimensional diabolo" whose shape is dictated by octonions (via G₂).

**Its characteristics**:
- 7 dimensions (like the 7 imaginary units of octonions)
- 21 "2D holes" (b₂ = 21)
- 77 "3D holes" (b₃ = 77)
- A very special curvature (G₂ holonomy)

**In K₇**: Everything flows from K₇. It's THE shape of the hidden universe.

---

### Fiber Bundle

**The fancy word**: Total space projecting onto a base space with fibers.

**The kitchen table version**: The hairbrush.

Imagine a hairbrush:
- The **base** = the flat handle
- The **fibers** = the bristles (one at each point on the handle)
- The **total bundle** = the whole brush

At each point of the base, there's a "fiber" attached. The whole thing forms the bundle.

**In physics**: Spacetime is the base, and at each point are attached "fibers" containing information about fields.

**In K₇**: K₇ is "fibered" over spacetime in a specific way.

---

## Topology: The Play-Doh Mathematics

### Topology vs Geometry

**The fancy word**: Study of properties invariant under continuous deformation.

**The kitchen table version**: Play-Doh vs ice sculpture.

- **Geometry** (ice sculpture): Exact distances matter. Change a millimeter and it's ruined.
- **Topology** (Play-Doh): You can stretch, squash, twist... as long as you don't cut or glue, it's "the same thing."

**The classic**: Coffee mug = donut. Both have exactly 1 hole (the mug handle = the donut hole). You can deform one into the other without cutting or gluing.

**In K₇**: Physical constants are topological: they come from the "number of holes," not distances. That's why they're stable and universal.

---

### Topological Invariants

**The fancy word**: Quantities unchanged by continuous deformation.

**The kitchen table version**: A shape's DNA.

You can change your hairstyle, clothes, gain or lose weight... but your DNA stays the same.

Topological invariants are shapes' DNA. You can deform K₇ in a thousand ways, b₂ will stay 21 and b₃ will stay 77.

**In K₇**: Physical constants = the universe's DNA. They can't be different.

---

### Betti Numbers

**The fancy word**: Ranks of homology groups, counting independent cycles.

**The kitchen table version**: Counting holes in Swiss cheese.

| Betti | Counts what | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| b₀ | Separate pieces | 1 block of cheese = 1 |
| b₁ | Through-tunnels | Hole you can poke through |
| b₂ | Enclosed bubbles | Trapped cavity |
| b₃ | 3D "hyper-bubbles" | (hard to visualize!) |

**For K₇**:
- b₀ = 1 (one piece)
- b₁ = 0 (no tunnels)
- b₂ = 21 (21 independent 2D bubbles)
- b₃ = 77 (77 independent 3D hyper-bubbles)

**Why these specific numbers?**
- 21 = 3 × 7 (three times the 7 points of the Fano plane)
- 77 = 7 × 11 (seven times 11)

**In K₇**: These two numbers are enough to calculate almost all physical constants! For example, sin²θ_W = 21/(77+14) = 3/13.

---

### Cohomology

**The fancy word**: Dual theory of homology, with cochains.

**The kitchen table version**: The cosmic land registry.

If homology counts holes, cohomology **classifies and labels them**.

It's like the difference between:
- Counting lakes on a map (homology)
- Making the official registry with area, depth, etc. (cohomology)

**In K₇**: H² and H³ of K₇ give the spaces where different physical fields "live."

---

### Holonomy

**The fancy word**: Group of transformations obtained by parallel transport around loops.

**The kitchen table version**: Santa Claus's test.

Santa Claus leaves the North Pole with his compass pointing South. He goes to the equator, turns right, goes around the Earth, returns to the North Pole.

**Result**: His compass has rotated 90°! Nobody touched it, it's the **curvature of the Earth** that did it.

Holonomy measures "how much things rotate when you make a loop."

**G₂-holonomy** = K₇'s curvature rotates things exactly according to G₂ rules (the 14 allowed directions).

**In K₇**: G₂ holonomy is what links K₇'s shape to the octonions.

---

### Euler Characteristic

**The fancy word**: Alternating sum of Betti numbers: χ = Σ(-1)ⁿbₙ.

**The kitchen table version**: Euler's magic formula.

For any polyhedron: **Vertices - Edges + Faces = 2**

A cube: 8 - 12 + 6 = 2 ✓
A tetrahedron: 4 - 6 + 4 = 2 ✓

This formula generalizes to all dimensions!

**In K₇**: χ(K₇) is linked to the number of generations via the Atiyah-Singer index.

---

### Torsion

**The fancy word**: Measure of a connection's deviation from being torsion-free.

**The kitchen table version**: The corkscrew.

Imagine you walk straight ahead, but space itself "twists" like a corkscrew. You end up having rotated without wanting to.

Torsion measures this "twisting" of space.

**In K₇**: Torsion must be very small (κ_T = 1/61) for physics to be consistent.

**In K₇**: The current programme aims to prove a torsion-free metric on K₇.
The usual Joyce theorem is not enough in the collapsing K3-fibred regime; the
missing analytic step is the anisotropic perturbation theorem tracked in
`docs/analytic_status.md`.

---

### Differential Forms

**The fancy word**: Section of an exterior bundle, generalizations of functions and vector fields.

**The kitchen table version**: The flux detector.

Imagine different types of "detectors":
- **0-form**: Thermometer (measures a value at a point)
- **1-form**: Anemometer (measures flux through a line)
- **2-form**: Rain gauge (measures flux through a surface)
- **3-form**: Volume counter (measures what enters a volume)

Differential forms generalize this to any dimension.

**In K₇**: The 3-form φ (G₂'s associative form) defines K₇'s structure.

---

# Part III: The Particles

## Fermions and Bosons

### Fermions

**The fancy word**: Half-integer spin particles obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics.

**The kitchen table version**: The individualists.

Fermions are "antisocial" particles: **two fermions can never be in the same place in the same state**.

That's why matter is solid! Electrons (fermions) repel each other and don't compress infinitely.

**The family**: Electrons, quarks, neutrinos, muons, taus...

**The spin thing**: You need to rotate a fermion 720° (two turns) to return to the initial state!

**In K₇**: Fermions are associated with H³(K₇), hence b₃ = 77.

---

### Bosons

**The fancy word**: Integer spin particles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics.

**The kitchen table version**: The social butterflies.

Bosons love being together: **they can all pile up in the same place in the same state**.

That's what enables lasers (lots of identical photons) and Bose-Einstein condensates (ultra-cold matter).

**The family**: Photons, gluons, W, Z, Higgs, graviton (hypothetical)...

**In K₇**: Bosons are associated with H²(K₇), hence b₂ = 21.

---

## The Particle Zoo

### Electron

**The fancy word**: First-generation charged lepton, mass 0.511 MeV.

**The kitchen table version**: The little sister.

The electron is the lightest charged lepton. It's the one that orbits atoms and makes electricity.

It has two heavier siblings: the muon (×207) and the tau (×3477).

**In K₇**: The electron defines the fundamental scale λ_e = h/m_e c.

---

### Muon and Tau

**The fancy word**: 2nd and 3rd generation charged leptons.

**The kitchen table version**: The overweight siblings.

Exactly like the electron, but heavier:
- **Muon**: ×207 (lives ~2 microseconds)
- **Tau**: ×3477 (lives ~0.3 picoseconds)

Nobody knew why these precise ratios. K₇ says:
- m_μ/m_e = 27^φ (golden ratio!)
- m_τ/m_e = 7 + 10×248 + 10×99 = 3477

**In K₇**: The three sisters (Koide) = dim(G₂)/b₂ = 14/21 = 2/3.

---

### Neutrinos

**The fancy word**: Neutral leptons, very light, weakly interacting.

**The kitchen table version**: The ghosts.

Neutrinos pass through matter as if it didn't exist. Billions pass through you every second without you knowing.

They "oscillate" between three types (electron, muon, tau) while traveling, it's like they change costumes in flight.

**In K₇**: Neutrino mixing angles (θ₁₂, θ₁₃, θ₂₃) and CP phase (δ = 197°) are derived from topology.

---

### Quarks

**The fancy word**: Fermions carrying color charge, confined in hadrons.

**The kitchen table version**: The prisoners.

Quarks are **always** locked up in groups of 2 or 3. You can never see one alone, that's "confinement."

**The 6 types**:
- Up, Down (light, in protons/neutrons)
- Charm, Strange (medium)
- Top, Bottom (heavy)

**In K₇**: Quark mass ratios like m_s/m_d = 20 are derived from topology.

---

### Higgs Boson

**The fancy word**: Scalar boson of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism.

**The kitchen table version**: The cosmic molasses.

The Higgs field fills the entire universe like invisible molasses. Particles that interact with it "get stuck" and acquire mass. Those that don't interact (photons) remain massless.

**Discovery**: 2012 at the LHC, 2013 Nobel Prize.

**In K₇**: λ_H (Higgs coupling) = √17/32 = √(dim(G₂) + N_gen) / 2^Weyl.

---

### Photon

**The fancy word**: Gauge boson of electromagnetism, zero mass, spin 1.

**The kitchen table version**: The messenger of light.

The photon IS light. It carries the electromagnetic force between charged particles. It always travels at the speed of light and has no mass.

**In K₇**: Vacuum impedance (377 ohms) is linked to α via E₈ structures.

---

### Gluons

**The fancy word**: Gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics, numbering 8.

**The kitchen table version**: The nuclear superglue.

Gluons "glue" quarks together. But unlike photons, gluons **carry the charge themselves** (color), so they interact with each other!

**Why 8?** That's the dimension of SU(3). And 8 = dim(𝕆), the dimension of octonions!

**In K₇**: α_s = √2/12 (strong coupling) comes from dim(G₂) - 2 = 12.

---

### W and Z Bosons

**The fancy word**: Gauge bosons of the weak interaction, massive.

**The kitchen table version**: The heavy messengers.

W⁺, W⁻ and Z⁰ carry the weak force (the one behind radioactivity). Unlike the photon, they're very heavy (~80-90 GeV), which is why the weak force has short range.

**In K₇**: M_Z/M_W = √(13/10) comes from sin²θ_W = 3/13.

---

# Part IV: The Forces

### Electromagnetism

**The fancy word**: U(1) interaction between electric charges.

**The kitchen table version**: Magnets and electricity are the same thing.

Maxwell showed in 1865 that electricity and magnetism are two faces of the same force. Light is an electromagnetic wave.

- **Gauge group**: U(1)
- **Carrier**: Photon
- **Range**: Infinite

**In K₇**: α = 1/137.033 determines the strength.

---

### Weak Force

**The fancy word**: SU(2) interaction responsible for β decays.

**The kitchen table version**: The cosmic alchemist.

Most forces just push and pull things around. The weak force is different: it can **change what something is**. A neutron can become a proton. A down quark can flip into an up quark. A muon can decay into an electron and two ghostly neutrinos.

Imagine a magician who doesn't just move cards around the table: she actually transforms a queen of spades into a jack of hearts mid-shuffle. That's the weak force. And like a good stage trick, the transformation is subtle: it only works at extremely short range (10⁻¹⁸ meters, much smaller than a proton), and it carries a hidden direction (a chirality, a "left-handedness") that's invisible to the naked eye but built into the equations.

- **Gauge group**: SU(2)
- **Carriers**: W⁺, W⁻, Z⁰
- **Range**: ~10⁻¹⁸ m (very short!)

**In K₇**: sin²θ_W = 3/13 describes weak/EM mixing.

---

### Strong Force

**The fancy word**: SU(3) interaction between quarks via gluons.

**The kitchen table version**: The universe's rubber band.

Most forces get **weaker** with distance. Gravity, electromagnetism (pull two magnets apart and it's easier to pull them further. The strong force does the **opposite**: pull two quarks apart and the force *grows*, like an elastic band stretching. Pull hard enough, and instead of separating, the band snaps and **two new quarks materialize** at the break) one for each end. You can never isolate a single quark; the universe physically refuses.

This is why we never see "free quarks" wandering around. They're permanently in jail, three at a time inside protons and neutrons, or two at a time inside mesons. The strong force isn't just strong, it's **strategically incarcerating**.

- **Gauge group**: SU(3)
- **Carriers**: 8 gluons
- **Range**: ~10⁻¹⁵ m

**In K₇**: α_s = √2/12 ≈ 0.1179 at the M_Z scale.

### Gravitation

**The fancy word**: Spacetime curvature according to general relativity.

**The kitchen table version**: The cosmic trampoline.

Imagine spacetime as a trampoline. Masses "push down" on the trampoline, creating dips. Other objects roll toward these dips, that's gravity!

- **Carrier (hypothetical)**: Graviton (spin 2)
- **Range**: Infinite

**In K₇**: Gravity potentially emerges from E₈ × E₈ structures at the Planck scale.

---

### Electroweak Unification

**The fancy word**: U(1) × SU(2) unifying EM and weak above ~100 GeV.

**The kitchen table version**: The cocktail before mixing.

At very high energy, electromagnetism and the weak force are indistinguishable, like vodka and orange juice in the glass before mixing.

As it cools, the "cocktail" separates: you get EM (photon) and weak (W, Z).

**The mixing angle**: sin²θ_W ≈ 0.231 says "how much" of each.

**In K₇**: sin²θ_W = 21/91 = 3/13 = b₂/(b₃ + dim(G₂)).

---

### Gauge Groups

**The fancy word**: Local symmetry group defining fundamental interactions.

**The kitchen table version**: The rules of the card game.

In a card game, certain rules define what's "allowed":
- In poker, a pair beats a high card
- In bridge, trumps beat everything

A gauge group is **the set of rules that define a force**.

- U(1) → rules of electromagnetism
- SU(2) → rules of the weak force
- SU(3) → rules of the strong force
- E₈ × E₈ → K₇'s meta-rules (where the others come from)

**In K₇**: E₈ × E₈ is the "original card game" from which all others are simplifications.

# Part V: The Magic Numbers

### Fine Structure Constant (α ≈ 1/137)

**The fancy word**: α = e²/4πε₀ℏc ≈ 1/137.036

**The kitchen table version**: The universe's thermostat.

Imagine you could turn a single dial that controls how strongly light and matter interact. That dial is α ≈ 1/137.

- **Turn it up by 4%**: stars stop making carbon. No carbon means no us.
- **Turn it down by 4%**: protons can't bind in nuclei. No atoms heavier than hydrogen.
- **Turn it up by 50%**: atoms collapse. The universe becomes pure radiation.

For 60+ years, physicists have measured this number to insane precision (10 decimal places, currently) but had no idea **why** it has this value rather than any other.

Feynman, 1985 (*QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter*): *"It's one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the 'hand of God' wrote that number, and 'we don't know how He pushed His pencil.'"*

**K₇'s claim**: it's not magic. `α⁻¹ = 137.033` emerges from the topology of K₇, as `128 + 9 + correction`, where `128 = 2⁷` (the 7 hidden dimensions of K₇) and `9 = 99/11` (a ratio of topological invariants). Feynman's "great damn mystery" becomes a **consequence of shape**.

---

### Weak Mixing Angle (sin²θ_W ≈ 0.231)

**The fancy word**: Electroweak model parameter relating couplings.

**The kitchen table version**: The electroweak cocktail recipe.

At very high energy, electromagnetism and the weak force are **the same force**, like orange juice and vodka before being mixed.

sin²θ_W ≈ 0.231 means "about 23% weak force, 77% electromagnetism" in the final mix.

**K₇**: sin²θ_W = 21/91 = 3/13

It's the number of "2D bubbles" (21) divided by the total (77 + 14 = 91).

**In K₇**: The cocktail recipe isn't arbitrary, it's dictated by the shape of the cosmic shaker (K₇).

---

### Koide Relation (Q = 2/3)

**The fancy word**: (√m_e + √m_μ + √m_τ)² / (m_e + m_μ + m_τ) = 2/3

**The kitchen table version**: The cosmic chord.

The three charged leptons (electron, muon, tau) have wildly different masses (the tau is ~3500× heavier than the electron). At first glance, they look like random numbers nature picked from a hat.

In 1982, Japanese physicist Yoshio Koide noticed something strange. Take the **square roots** of the three masses. Add them. Square the result. Divide by the **sum** of the masses. You get... not approximately, not "close to", but **exactly** 2/3, to the precision of the best measurements available.

It's as if three random pebbles, when struck together, produced a perfect musical chord.

For 40 years, this stayed an unexplained "numerical curiosity", too precise to be coincidence, too specific to derive from anything known.

**K₇ says**: 2/3 = 14/21 = `dim(G₂) / b₂`. The chord isn't accidental: the three lepton masses are constrained by the same geometric structure (the 14-dimensional G₂ symmetry inside the 21-dimensional second cohomology of K₇). The "tuning" of the cosmic chord is dictated by the shape of hidden space.

**In K₇**: This troubling coincidence becomes a logical consequence.

---

### Number of Generations (N = 3)

**The fancy word**: Why 3 fermion families in the Standard Model.

**The kitchen table version**: Why 3 Musketeers?

All particles come in 3 increasingly heavy "copies":
- Electron → Muon → Tau
- Up quark → Charm → Top
- Down quark → Strange → Bottom

Why not 2? Or 47?

**Before K₇**: "We observe 3, we don't know why."

**K₇**: The Fano plane has 168 symmetries. 168 ÷ 56 = **3**.

It's like asking "Why does a cube have 6 faces?" The answer isn't "just because," it's "because it's a cube." The shape imposes the number.

**In K₇**: The number of families isn't an accident, it's a geometric consequence.

---

### Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618)

**The fancy word**: φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618

**The kitchen table version**: The number that grows from itself.

φ ≈ 1.618 is famous for showing up in sunflower spirals, nautilus shells, and the Parthenon. But the deep reason it's everywhere isn't aesthetic, it's mathematical.

Take any positive number `x`. Compute `1 + 1/x`. You get a new number. Repeat. Almost any starting point converges to one specific value: **φ**. It's the fixed point of self-reference: `φ² = φ + 1`. In other words, **φ is the value you get when something defines itself in terms of itself**. Self-similar growth, optimal packing, Fibonacci sequences, all variations on this single equation.

**In K₇**: the muon-electron mass ratio is `m_μ / m_e = 27^φ ≈ 206.77`. The exponent is φ exactly (not a fitted parameter, but the fixed point of self-reference. The base 27 is the dimension of the exceptional Jordan algebra (E₆'s favorite playground). Mass ratios in K₇ aren't arbitrary numbers) they're what you get when geometry grows from itself.

---

### Planck Mass

**The fancy word**: M_Pl = √(ℏc/G) ≈ 2.18 × 10⁻⁸ kg

**The kitchen table version**: The scale where gravity goes quantum.

At the Planck scale (~10⁻³⁵ m), gravity and quantum mechanics become equally strong. That's where our current physics breaks down.

**In K₇**: The "scale bridge" connects M_Pl to m_e via topological invariants.

---

# Part VI: Why K₇ is Different

### Zero Free Parameters

**The fancy word**: Theory without adjustable constants.

**The kitchen table version**: IKEA vs Custom-made.

- **The Standard Model** = Custom furniture. The carpenter takes 19 measurements at your place and builds furniture that fits perfectly. But he can't explain *why* your living room has those dimensions.

- **K₇** = Universal IKEA furniture. The instructions say: "Take a 7-dimensional diabolo with G₂ holonomy." There's only one way to assemble it. The dimensions come out automatically.

**In K₇**: 19 mysterious numbers → 0 mysterious numbers. Everything comes from the shape.

---

### Falsifiability

**The fancy word**: A theory's ability to be refuted by experiment.

**The kitchen table version**: The real difference between science and horoscopes.

A horoscope says: "You will meet someone interesting." Impossible to disprove.

K₇ says: "The neutrino CP phase δ_CP = 197°, no more, no less."

The DUNE experiment will measure this in 2034-2039.

- If DUNE finds 197° ± 5° → K₇ survives
- If DUNE finds 250° → K₇ is dead. Done. We move on.

**That's science**: predictions that can die.

**In K₇**: K₇ plays the game honestly. It makes testable predictions.

---

### Naturalness

**The fancy word**: Absence of fine-tuning, order-1 parameters.

**The kitchen table version**: No miraculous adjustments.

A theory is "natural" if it doesn't need parameters tuned to 0.0000001% precision to work.

**In K₇**: Zero adjustable parameters = maximum naturalness.

---

### Emergence

**The fancy word**: Properties appearing at one level that don't exist at lower levels.

**The kitchen table version**: Water isn't "wet" at the atomic level.

Individual atoms aren't wet. "Wetness" emerges when billions of atoms are together.

**In K₇**: 4D physical constants "emerge" from 7D topology.

---

### Formal Verification

**The fancy word**: Machine-checked mathematical proofs using proof assistants.

**The kitchen table version**: The ultra-strict math teacher.

Lean 4 is a computer program that checks every step of every proof. You can't cheat, can't make calculation errors, can't "skip" a step. If Lean accepts your proof, it's **mathematically certain**.

**In K₇**: 290+ relations verified in Lean 4 with 0 "sorry" (holes). Zero domain-specific axioms.

---

# Part VII: The Experiments

### PDG (Particle Data Group)

**The fancy word**: International collaboration compiling particle physics data.

**The kitchen table version**: The official particle encyclopedia.

The PDG publishes the best values for all masses, lifetimes, etc. every year. It's THE reference.

**In K₇**: All comparisons use PDG 2024.

---

### LHC (Large Hadron Collider)

**The fancy word**: Hadron collider at CERN, 27 km circumference.

**The kitchen table version**: The world's biggest microscope.

The LHC accelerates protons to nearly the speed of light and smashes them together. The collision energy creates new particles (E = mc²).

**Major discovery**: Higgs boson (2012).

**In K₇**: The LHC measured W, Z, Higgs masses that K₇ predicts.

---

### DUNE

**The fancy word**: Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, detector in the USA.

**The kitchen table version**: The ghost hunter.

DUNE will send neutrinos 1300 km and study their oscillations with unprecedented precision.

**K₇ prediction**: δ_CP = 197° ± 5° (measurable 2034-2039)

**In K₇**: If DUNE finds δ_CP very different from 197°, K₇ is falsified. This is the key test.

---

### Planck (satellite)

**The fancy word**: ESA mission measuring the cosmic microwave background.

**The kitchen table version**: The universe's baby photo.

The Planck satellite took the most detailed "photo" of the Big Bang's fossil radiation: the oldest light in the universe.

**In K₇**: Planck measured Ω_DE, n_s, etc. that K₇ predicts.

---
