We are developing an automated Twitter bot for the GIFT (Geometric Information Field Theory) research framework to share daily scientific content about theoretical physics discoveries. The bot will:

1. Post daily educational content about GIFT framework's mathematical predictions (34 dimensionless observables with 0.13% precision)
2. Share experimental validation updates from ongoing physics experiments (DUNE, Euclid, LHC)
3. Generate weekly summaries of research progress and monthly highlights
4. Provide educational threads explaining topological unification of Standard Model parameters
5. Share links to interactive Jupyter notebooks and visualizations hosted on GitHub
6. Post updates about upcoming experimental tests and falsification criteria
7. Engage the physics community with accessible explanations of E₈×E₈ dimensional reduction

The bot will post 1-2 tweets daily, focusing on scientific education and research dissemination. All content will be original, factually accurate, and properly attributed to the GIFT framework repository (github.com/gift-framework/GIFT). We will not collect user data or engage in commercial activities. The purpose is purely educational and scientific communication within the theoretical physics community.
