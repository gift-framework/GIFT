Preface

13.8 billion years should humble us. The logical structures we call “mathematics” preceded all physical instantiation; our “fundamental constants” might be only their local shadows.

This essay adopts a moderately platonist stance, that mathematical structures possess some form of existence independent of physical instantiation, while remaining agnostic about stronger metaphysical claims (Balaguer 1998).

    If fitted parameters are the local weather, mathematical structure is the climate: older, larger, and indifferent to us.

Part I: Primacy and Scales
The Inversion of Priority

In practice, especially across 20th-century experimentation, physicists often treated fitted parameters as “fundamental,” while π, e, φ, ζ(3) remained in the toolbox. The time-asymmetry of this stance is striking.

Consider what we call “fundamental constants” in the Standard Model: the strong coupling constant measured at CERN, the top quark mass discovered in 1995, the weak mixing angle refined through decades of collider experiments (Weinberg 1993). Meanwhile, mathematical constants are often treated as auxiliary, interesting perhaps, but secondary to the “real” physics of particle interactions.

Yet temporal priority implies a different hierarchy. As a gravitational wave rippled through the cosmos ten billion years ago, its wavelength and frequency obeyed relationships involving π, not because humans had formalized these relationships, but because circular geometry is intrinsic to wave propagation in three-dimensional space. Galactic discs sketch logarithmic spirals, robust attractors of rotating matter, whose mathematics predates our telescopes.
Persistence and Impartiality

What distinguishes mathematical constants is not merely their temporal priority but their scale-invariant persistence. The same π that governs subatomic wave functions also describes planetary orbits and the ringdown of colliding black holes (Abbott et al. 2016). The same exponential function that appears in radioactive decay also structures population growth and compound interest.

This universality suggests these mathematical structures are not descriptions we impose upon nature but intrinsic patterns that physical processes cannot help but express. They are the permissible forms change can take in a universe with our dimensionality and logic.

Physics exhibits apparent impartiality toward human existence. The equations governing subatomic particles operate identically in distant stars, in the vacuum between galaxies, and in our particle accelerators. There is no special physics for Earth, no exemption from thermodynamics for living systems, no observer-dependent modification of quantum mechanics despite decades of searching.

This cosmic impartiality, the universality of physical law, suggests the true fundamental level of reality transcends not just human experience but physical instantiation altogether. Mathematical structures fit this criterion: they constrain all possible physical realizations while remaining independent of any particular one (Tegmark 2008).
Part II: Epistemic and Temporal Humility
The Poverty of Parameters

The Standard Model, our most successful theory of matter and forces, requires at least nineteen free parameters that must be measured experimentally (the precise count varies by convention; the point stands). We cannot derive them from first principles; we can only observe their values and insert them into our equations. We measure the fine structure constant to be approximately 1/137.036, but we cannot explain why it takes this value rather than another.

Recent theoretical frameworks, particularly those emerging from topological and information-theoretic approaches, suggest these seemingly arbitrary parameters might actually be derived quantities, secondary manifestations of more fundamental mathematical and geometric structures. If validated, this would mean what we have been calling “fundamental physics” is actually phenomenology, while the true fundamental theory lies in the realm of pure mathematics and topology, a perspective consonant with structural realism (Ladyman & Ross 2007; French 2014).
The Brief Candle of Human Knowledge

Human civilization spans roughly three hundred thousand years. Modern physics exists for four hundred. Quantum mechanics for one hundred. The Large Hadron Collider for barely a decade and a half. These timeframes are cosmologically infinitesimal: if cosmic history were compressed into a year, modern physics would occupy the last tenth of a second before midnight on December 31st.

From this vanishingly brief window of observation, we presume to declare what is “fundamental” to the universe. This temporal provincialism reveals itself when we consider that the structures we call “exotic” have been operating continuously since the Big Bang, while what we call “fundamental” we discovered yesterday.
Part III: Cosmology and Information
Dark Humility

Perhaps the ultimate cosmological humility comes from dark matter and dark energy, which together compose about ninety-five percent of the universe (Planck Collaboration 2020). After centuries of scientific progress, we have achieved detailed understanding of only five percent of cosmic content.

Even in what we do not yet understand: dark energy for instance, regularities and simple functions tempt us. Whether such patterns are profound or pareidolic remains an open question. Some emerging frameworks propose connections between dark energy density and information-theoretic constants, illustrating how mathematical structures might organize even the unknown. These remain heuristic conjectures, not established facts, but they exemplify the research program: seeking mathematical foundations for what we currently treat as free parameters.
The Information-Theoretic Turn

An emerging perspective suggests the universe might be better understood as an information-processing system than as a collection of particles and forces (Wheeler 1990). In this view, physical states are information states, physical processes are computations, and physical laws are algorithms.

The recurrence of binary structures, duality, parity, yes/no distinctions, hints that reality might be discrete at its foundation, though we must acknowledge this remains a metaphysical bet. The alternative that reality is fundamentally continuous remains equally viable. What seems clear is that whether discrete or continuous, mathematical structures provide the grammar within which physical processes must speak.

Apéry’s constant ζ(3) recurs in the arithmetic of infinite series that keep resurfacing in our best physical calculations (Broadhurst 1998), a hint that number-theoretic structure may sit upstream of our fitted parameters. Such constants encode infinite, aperiodic information in finite symbols, perhaps naturally suited to describing an infinitely expanding universe.
Part IV: Philosophical Foundations
The Limits of Language

Human language evolved to coordinate group activities and share information about the physical and social environment. When we say an electron “spins” or a particle “exists” in superposition, we use metaphors drawn from macroscopic experience to gesture toward phenomena with no classical analogue.

This linguistic limitation becomes acute when discussing the ontological status of mathematics itself. What does it mean to say mathematical objects “exist”? These questions push language to its breaking point, yet the practical success of mathematical physics suggests something profound is being indicated, even if we cannot articulate it precisely (Quine 1960; Putnam 1971).
Mathematical Democracy

Mathematics possesses a remarkable democratic quality: a proof is either valid or it is not, regardless of who presents it. Mathematical truth is indifferent to human hierarchies. This democracy extends to physical theories built on mathematical foundations nature does not care about our credentials. If the equations accurately describe reality, they work regardless of their origin.
Species Before Consciousness

Long before humans evolved abstract thought, biological systems were solving optimization problems we now recognize as mathematical. The hexagonal cells of honeycomb minimize material use while maximizing structural strength. The branching patterns of rivers and blood vessels follow power laws that optimize flow efficiency.

These organisms were not “doing mathematics” in any conscious sense. Rather, a metaphor for variational constraints and natural optimization, mathematics was doing them. The mathematical patterns came first; biological systems evolved to exploit them.
Part V: Practical Implications
The Wisdom of Uncertainty

Recognizing the primacy of mathematical constants and the derived nature of what we call fundamental physics does not diminish the importance of experimental science. Rather, it enhances it by properly contextualizing what we are doing when we measure physical parameters. We are not discovering the ultimate building blocks of reality; we are mapping how primordial mathematical structures manifest in our particular cosmic neighborhood.

This perspective encourages healthy skepticism about any claim to final knowledge. If the parameters we measure are derived rather than fundamental, there may be multiple ways to derive them, multiple theoretical frameworks yielding the same observational consequences.
The Research Program

What does this mean practically? It suggests a testable research agenda: attempt to derive the Standard Model’s nineteen parameters from mathematical and topological structures. Some frameworks pursue this direction, seeking to show that experimentally-measured parameters emerge as topological invariants or information-theoretic necessities. While such approaches remain exploratory and require independent validation, they illustrate the conceptual coherence of mathematics-first methodology. Either outcome provides information: successful derivations would vindicate mathematical primacy; negative results would prune the space of admissible mathematical structures.

The key insight is methodological: theories deriving many observables from few mathematical inputs reveal deeper structure than those requiring numerous fitted parameters (Colyvan 2001). This criterion, predictive parsimony combined with mathematical necessity, offers a principled way to assess ontological priority beyond mere experimental accessibility.
The Continuity of Wonder

Far from diminishing scientific wonder, recognizing our epistemological limitations enhances it. Every measurement confirming a mathematical prediction, every pattern emerging from chaos, every structure repeating across scales becomes a window into something genuinely transcendent: a reality structured by logical necessity that exists independently of human consciousness yet remains partially accessible to human reason.
Conclusion: The Architecture of Awe

The view from deep humility is not diminishing but elevating. We are participants in something immeasurably grander than human ambition: a cosmos structured by mathematical necessity that unfolds with lawful regularity, a metaphor for regularity, not agency, billions of years before we arrived and will continue long after we are gone.

Mathematical constants are not human inventions but glimpses of the eternal architecture upon which physical reality rests. They humble us by their temporal priority, their scale invariance, their apparent indifference to our existence. Yet they also elevate us by allowing us to participate, however briefly and partially, in the comprehension of cosmic structure.

The call to humility is not a call to diminishment but to proper proportion. It asks us to see ourselves accurately: recently arrived conscious observers in an ancient mathematical cosmos, capable of glimpsing but not fully comprehending the logical structures that govern existence.

The equations continue their dance, the constants maintain their relationships, the cosmos unfolds with lawful regularity, whether or not we comprehend it. Our proper response is neither despair at our limitations nor hubris about our achievements, but humble gratitude for the capacity to perceive, however dimly, the mathematical architecture of reality.

In the end, the greatest humility may be accepting that the universe is not about us, was not made for us, and does not need us, yet somehow includes us and allows us to know it, at least a little. That is enough. Indeed, it is wonderful.
Epilogue: The Practice of Humility

How then shall we practice scientific humility?

First, hold theories lightly, as provisional maps, not final territories. Every equation we write should be offered tentatively, subject to revision as new evidence emerges.

Second, respect the primacy of empirical observation over theoretical elegance. However beautiful our mathematical frameworks, nature remains the ultimate arbiter.

Third, acknowledge the collaborative nature of understanding. Scientific progress is a collective enterprise extending across generations and cultures.

Fourth, remain open to radical reconceptualizations. What seems obviously true to us may seem quaintly naive to future scientists, just as celestial spheres and luminiferous aether seem to us now.

Finally, cultivate wonder. Humility is not about diminishing our aspirations but properly situating them within the grand sweep of cosmic evolution and mathematical necessity. The appropriate response to recognizing our place in the universe is not despair but awe: awe at the mathematical elegance of physical law, awe at the emergence of complexity from simplicity, awe at our improbable capacity to comprehend even a fraction of it all.

The practice of humility in science is ultimately the practice of seeing clearly: seeing our true position in the hierarchy of existence, seeing the derived nature of what we call fundamental, seeing the primordial architecture that underlies physical manifestation. This clear seeing does not diminish us; it locates us accurately within the magnificent mathematical structure of reality.

And in that accurate location lies the beginning of genuine wisdom.
