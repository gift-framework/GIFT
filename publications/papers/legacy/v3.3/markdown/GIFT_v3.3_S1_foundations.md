## Abstract

This supplement presents the mathematical architecture underlying GIFT. Part I develops the E₈ exceptional Lie algebra with the exceptional chain identity. Part II introduces G₂ holonomy manifolds, including the correct characterization of the g₂ subalgebra as the kernel of the Lie derivative map. Part III presents a K₇ topological blueprint via the twisted connected sum framework, deriving Betti numbers and cohomological invariants from asymptotically cylindrical building blocks (conditional on existence of appropriate smooth G₂ manifold). Part IV establishes the algebraic reference form determining det(g) = 65/32, with Joyce's theorem guaranteeing existence of a torsion-free metric. PINN validation achieves a torsion scaling law ∇φ(L) = 8.46 × 10⁻⁴/L² and spectral fingerprint [1, 10, 9, 30] at 5.8σ significance. All algebraic results are formally verified in Lean 4.

# Part 0: The Octonionic Foundation

## 0. Why This Framework Exists

The GIFT framework emerges from a single algebraic fact:

**The octonions 𝕆 are the largest normed division algebra.**

The derivation chain 𝕆 → G₂ → K₇ → predictions is described in the main paper (Section 1.3). This supplement develops the mathematical foundations for each step.

### 0.1 The Division Algebra Chain

The Hurwitz theorem establishes that no normed division algebra of dimension greater than 8 exists. The chain ℝ → ℂ → ℍ → 𝕆 terminates at the octonions (see main paper, Section 2.1 for the complete table). This non-extendability forces the exceptional structures: G₂ = Aut(𝕆), dim = 14.

### 0.2 G₂ as Octonionic Automorphisms

**Definition**: G₂ = {g ∈ GL(𝕆) : g(xy) = g(x)g(y) for all x,y ∈ 𝕆}

| Property | Value | GIFT Role |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| dim(G₂) | 14 = C(7,2) − C(7,1) = 21 − 7 | Q_Koide numerator |
| Action | Transitive on S⁶ ⊂ Im(𝕆) | Connects all directions |
| Embedding | G₂ ⊂ SO(7) | Preserves φ₀ |

### 0.3 Why dim(K₇) = 7

The dimension 7 is a consequence of the octonionic structure, not an independent choice:
- Im(𝕆) has dimension 7
- G₂ acts naturally on ℝ⁷
- A compact 7-manifold with G₂ holonomy provides the geometric realization

In this sense, K₇ is to G₂ what the circle is to U(1).

### 0.4 The Fano Plane: Combinatorial Structure of Im(𝕆)

The 7 imaginary octonion units form the **Fano plane** PG(2,2), the smallest projective plane:
- 7 points (imaginary units e₁...e₇)
- 7 lines (multiplication triples eᵢ × eⱼ = ±eₖ)
- 3 points per line

**Combinatorial counts**:
- Point-line incidences: 7 × 3 = 21 = C(7,2) = b₂
- Automorphism group: PSL(2,7) with |PSL(2,7)| = 168

**Numerical observation**: The following arithmetic identity holds:
$$(b_3 + \dim(G_2)) + b_3 = 91 + 77 = 168 = |{\rm PSL}(2,7)| = {\rm rank}(E_8) \times b_2$$

Whether this reflects deeper geometric structure connecting gauge and matter sectors, or is an arithmetic coincidence, remains an open question.

# Part I: E₈ Exceptional Lie Algebra

## 1. Root System and Dynkin Diagram

### 1.1 Basic Data

| Property | Value | GIFT Role |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Dimension | dim(E₈) = 248 | Gauge DOF |
| Rank | rank(E₈) = 8 | Cartan subalgebra |
| Number of roots | |Φ(E₈)| = 240 | E₈ kissing number |
| Root length | √2 | α_s numerator |
| Coxeter number | h = 30 | Icosahedron edges |
| Dual Coxeter number | h∨ = 30 | McKay correspondence |

### 1.2 Root System Construction

E₈ root system in ℝ⁸ has 240 roots:

**Type I (112 roots)**: Permutations and sign changes of (±1, ±1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

**Type II (128 roots)**: Half-integer coordinates with even minus signs:
$$\frac{1}{2}(\pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1)$$

**Verification**: 112 + 128 = 240 roots, all length √2.

**Lean Status (v3.3.24)**: E₈ Root System **12/12 COMPLETE**. All theorems proven:
- `D8_roots_card` = 112, `HalfInt_roots_card` = 128
- `E8_roots_card` = 240, `E8_roots_decomposition`
- `E8_inner_integral`, `E8_norm_sq_even`, `E8_sub_closed`
- `E8_basis_generates`: Every lattice vector is integer combination of simple roots (theorem)

### 1.3 Cartan Matrix

$$A_{E_8} = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}$$

**Properties**: det(A) = 1 (unimodular), positive definite.

## 2. Weyl Group

### 2.1 Order and Factorization

$$|W(E_8)| = 696,729,600 = 2^{14} \times 3^5 \times 5^2 \times 7$$

### 2.2 Prime Factorization Identity

**Identity**: The Weyl group order factorizes entirely into GIFT constants:

$$|W(E_8)| = p_2^{\dim(G_2)} \times N_{gen}^{w} \times w^{p_2} \times \dim(K_7)$$

| Factor | Exponent | Value | GIFT Origin |
|--------|----------|-------|-------------|
| 2¹⁴ | dim(G₂) = 14 | 16384 | p₂^(holonomy dim) |
| 3⁵ | w = 5 | 243 | N_gen^w |
| 5² | p₂ = 2 | 25 | w^(binary) |
| 7¹ | 1 | 7 | dim(K₇) |

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `weyl_E8_topological_factorization`

## 2.3 Triple Derivation of w = 5

**Identity**: The pentagonal index w admits three independent derivations from topological invariants.

### Derivation 1: G₂ Dimensional Ratio

$$w = \frac{\dim(G_2) + 1}{N_{gen}} = \frac{14 + 1}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5$$

**Interpretation**: The holonomy dimension plus unity, distributed over generations.

### Derivation 2: Betti Reduction

$$w = \frac{b_2}{N_{gen}} - p_2 = \frac{21}{3} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5$$

**Interpretation**: The per-generation Betti contribution minus the dimensional ratio p₂.

### Derivation 3: Exceptional Difference

$$w = \dim(G_2) - \text{rank}(E_8) - 1 = 14 - 8 - 1 = 5$$

**Interpretation**: The gap between holonomy dimension and gauge rank, reduced by unity.

### Unified Identity

These three derivations establish the **pentagonal triple identity**:

$$\boxed{\frac{\dim(G_2) + 1}{N_{gen}} = \frac{b_2}{N_{gen}} - p_2 = \dim(G_2) - \text{rank}(E_8) - 1 = 5}$$

**Status**: VERIFIED (algebraic identity from GIFT constants)

### Verification

| Expression | Computation | Result |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| (dim(G₂) + 1) / N_gen | (14 + 1) / 3 | 5 |
| b₂/N_gen - p₂ | 21/3 - 2 | 5 |
| dim(G₂) - rank(E₈) - 1 | 14 - 8 - 1 | 5 |

### Significance

The triple convergence suggests w = 5 is structurally constrained by the E₈ x E₈/G₂/K₇ geometry. It enters:

1. **det(g) = 65/32**: Via w × (rank(E₈) + w) / 2^w = 5 × 13 / 32
2. **|W(E₈)| factorization**: The factor 5² = w^p₂ in prime decomposition
3. **Cosmological ratio**: √w = √5 appears in dark sector density ratios (see main paper, Section 5.8)

**Status**: VERIFIED (three independent derivations)

## 3. Exceptional Chain

### 3.1 The Pattern

A pattern connects exceptional algebra dimensions to primes:

| Algebra | n | dim(E_n) | Prime | Index |
|---------|---|----------|-------|-------|
| E₆ | 6 | 78 | 13 | prime(6) |
| E₇ | 7 | 133 | 19 | prime(8) = prime(rank(E₈)) |
| E₈ | 8 | 248 | 31 | prime(11) = prime(D_bulk) |

### 3.2 Exceptional Chain Identity

**Identity**: For n ∈ {6, 7, 8}:
$$\dim(E_n) = n \times prime(g(n))$$

where g(6) = 6, g(7) = rank(E₈) = 8, g(8) = D_bulk = 11.

**Proof** (verified in Lean):
- E₆: 6 × 13 = 78 ✓
- E₇: 7 × 19 = 133 ✓
- E₈: 8 × 31 = 248 ✓

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `exceptional_chain_certified`

## 4. E₈×E₈ Product Structure

### 4.1 Direct Sum

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Dimension | 496 = 248 × 2 |
| Rank | 16 = 8 × 2 |
| Roots | 480 = 240 × 2 |

### 4.2 τ Numerator Connection

The hierarchy parameter numerator:
$$\tau_{num} = 3472 = 7 \times 496 = \dim(K_7) \times \dim(E_8 \times E_8)$$

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `tau_num_E8xE8`

### 4.3 Binary Duality Parameter

**Triple geometric origin of p₂ = 2**:

1. **Local**: p₂ = dim(G₂)/dim(K₇) = 14/7 = 2
2. **Global**: p₂ = dim(E₈×E₈)/dim(E₈) = 496/248 = 2
3. **Root**: √2 in E₈ root normalization

---

## 5. Exceptional Algebras from Octonions

The foundational role of octonions is established in Part 0. This section details the exceptional algebraic structures that emerge from 𝕆.

### 5.1 Exceptional Jordan Algebra J₃(O)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| dim(J₃(O)) | 27 = 3³ |
| dim(J₃(O)₀) | 26 (traceless) |

**E-series formula (v3.3)**: The dimension 27 itself emerges from the exceptional chain:

$$\dim(J_3(\mathbb{O})) = \frac{\dim(E_8) - \dim(E_6) - \dim(SU_3)}{6} = \frac{248 - 78 - 8}{6} = \frac{162}{6} = 27$$

This shows the Jordan algebra dimension is derivable from the E-series structure.

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `j3o_e_series_certificate`

### 5.2 F₄ Connection

F₄ is the automorphism group of J₃(O):
$$\dim(F_4) = 52 = p_2^2 \times \alpha_{sum}^B = 4 \times 13$$

### 5.3 Exceptional Differences

| Difference | Value | GIFT |
|------------|-------|------|
| dim(E₈) - dim(J₃(O)) | 221 = 13 × 17 | α_B × λ_H_num |
| dim(F₄) - dim(J₃(O)) | 25 = 5² | w² |
| dim(E₆) - dim(F₄) | 26 | dim(J₃(O)₀) |

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `exceptional_differences_certified`

### 5.4 Structural Derivation of τ (v3.3)

The hierarchy parameter τ admits a purely geometric derivation from framework invariants:

$$\tau = \frac{\dim(E_8 \times E_8) \times b_2}{\dim(J_3(\mathbb{O})) \times H^*} = \frac{496 \times 21}{27 \times 99} = \frac{10416}{2673} = \frac{3472}{891}$$

**Prime factorization**:
- Numerator: 3472 = 2⁴ × 7 × 31 = dim(K₇) × dim(E₈×E₈)
- Denominator: 891 = 3⁴ × 11 = N_gen⁴ × D_bulk

**Alternative form**: τ_num = 7 × 496 = dim(K₇) × dim(E₈×E₈) = 3472

This anchors τ to topological and algebraic invariants, establishing it as a geometric constant rather than a free parameter.

# Part II: G₂ Holonomy Manifolds

## 6. Definition and Properties

### 6.1 G₂ as Exceptional Holonomy

| Property | Value | GIFT Role |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| dim(G₂) | 14 | Q_Koide numerator |
| rank(G₂) | 2 | Lie rank |
| Definition | Aut(O) | Octonion automorphisms |

**Lean Status (v3.3.24)**: G₂ Cross Product **9/11** proven:
- `epsilon_antisymm`, `epsilon_diag`, `cross_apply` ✓
- `G2_cross_bilinear`, `G2_cross_antisymm`, `cross_self` ✓
- `G2_cross_norm` (Lagrange identity ‖u×v‖² = ‖u‖²‖v‖² − ⟨u,v⟩²) ✓
- `reflect_preserves_lattice` (Weyl reflection) ✓
- Remaining: `cross_is_octonion_structure` (343-case timeout), `G2_equiv_characterizations`

### 6.2 G₂ as Kernel of the Lie Derivative

The G₂ subalgebra of so(7) admits a precise characterization as the stabilizer of the associative 3-form phi₀. For any antisymmetric matrix A in so(7), the Lie derivative of phi₀ is:

$$L_A(\varphi_0)_{ijk} = A_{ia}\varphi_{ajk} + A_{ja}\varphi_{iak} + A_{ka}\varphi_{ija}$$

The g₂ subalgebra consists of all A for which L_A(phi₀) = 0:

$$\mathfrak{g}_2 = \ker(L) = \{A \in \mathfrak{so}(7) : L_A(\varphi_0) = 0\}$$

This yields the decomposition so(7) = g₂ + V₇, where dim(g₂) = 14 and dim(V₇) = 7. The complement V₇ carries the standard 7-dimensional representation of G₂.

In practice, the kernel is computed via singular value decomposition (SVD) of the linear map L: so(7) --> Lambda³(R⁷). The 14 singular vectors with eigenvalue zero span g₂; the 7 singular vectors with nonzero eigenvalue span V₇.

**Note**: A heuristic construction based on Fano-plane indices does not produce correct g₂ generators (each such generator is approximately 67% in g₂ and 33% in V₇). The kernel-based construction is the correct definition and must be used in all numerical computations involving g₂/V₇ decomposition.

### 6.3 Holonomy Classification (Berger)

| Dimension | Holonomy | Geometry |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **7** | **G₂** | **Exceptional** |
| 8 | Spin(7) | Exceptional |

### 6.4 Torsion: Definition and GIFT Interpretation

**Mathematical definition**: Torsion measures failure of G₂ structure to be parallel:
$$T = \nabla\phi \neq 0$$

For a G₂ structure φ, the intrinsic torsion decomposes into four irreducible G₂-modules:

$$T \in W_1 \oplus W_7 \oplus W_{14} \oplus W_{27}$$

| Class | Dimension | Characterization |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| W₁ | 1 | Scalar: dφ = τ₀ ⋆φ |
| W₇ | 7 | Vector: dφ = 3τ₁ ∧ φ |
| W₁₄ | 14 | Co-closed part of d⋆φ |
| W₂₇ | 27 | Traceless symmetric |

**Total dimension**: 1 + 7 + 14 + 27 = 49 = 7² = dim(K₇)²

The torsion-free condition requires all four classes to vanish simultaneously, a highly constrained state with 49 conditions.

**Torsion-free condition**:
$$\nabla\phi = 0 \Leftrightarrow d\phi = 0 \text{ and } d*\phi = 0$$

**GIFT interpretation**:

| Quantity | Meaning | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| κ_T = 1/61 | Torsion parameter | Fixed by K₇ |
| φ_ref | Algebraic reference form | c × φ₀ |
| T_realized | Actual torsion for global solution | Constrained by Joyce |

**Key insight**: The 33 dimensionless predictions use only topological invariants (b₂, b₃, dim(G₂)) and are independent of the specific torsion realization. The value κ_T = 1/61 defines the geometric bound on deviations from φ_ref.

**Physical interactions**: Emerge from the geometry of K₇, with deviations delta(phi) from the reference form bounded by topological constraints. The complete dynamical framework connecting torsion to renormalization group flow via torsional geodesic equations is developed in the main paper (Section 3). There, the identification of geodesic flow parameter lambda = ln(mu/mu₀) with RG scale maps the torsion hierarchy directly onto physical observables: mass hierarchies, CP violation, and coupling evolution.

## 7. Topological Invariants

### 7.1 Derived Constants

| Constant | Formula | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| det(g) | p₂ + 1/(b₂ + dim(G₂) - N_gen) | 65/32 |
| κ_T | 1/(b₃ - dim(G₂) - p₂) | 1/61 |
| sin²θ_W | b₂/(b₃ + dim(G₂)) | 3/13 |

### 7.2 The 61 Decomposition

$$\kappa_T^{-1} = 61 = \dim(F_4) + N_{gen}^2 = 52 + 9$$

Alternative:
$$61 = \Pi(\alpha^2_B) + 1 = 2 \times 5 \times 6 + 1$$

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `kappa_T_inv_decomposition`

### 7.3 Spectral Geometry

The Laplace-Beltrami operator on K₇ admits a discrete spectrum with eigenvalues 0 = λ₀ < λ₁ ≤ λ₂ ≤ ... The first non-zero eigenvalue λ₁ (spectral gap) characterizes the geometry's rigidity.

**Bare spectral ratio**: For G₂-holonomy manifolds constructed via TCS, the bare topological ratio scales inversely with cohomological dimension:

$$\lambda_1^{\text{bare}} = \frac{\dim(G_2)}{H^*} = \frac{14}{b_2 + b_3 + 1}$$

For K₇ with b₂ = 21, b₃ = 77:
$$\lambda_1^{\text{bare}} = \frac{14}{99} = 0.1414...$$

**Physical spectral gap**: The Berger classification implies that G₂-holonomy manifolds admit exactly h = 1 parallel spinor. The corrected spectral-holonomy identity reads:

$$\lambda_1 \times H^* = \dim(G_2) - h = 14 - 1 = 13$$

giving the physical spectral gap:

$$\boxed{\lambda_1 = \frac{13}{99} = 0.1313...}$$

**Important**: The eigenvalue λ₁ = π²/L² depends on the metric scale (moduli). The ratio 13/99 is the topological proportionality constant; the actual spectral gap requires specifying moduli. The degeneracies [1, 10, 9, 30] are topological invariants independent of moduli.

The correction 14/99 − 13/99 = 1/99 = h/H* is the parallel spinor contribution. The ratio 13/99 is irreducible (gcd(13, 99) = 1). Cross-holonomy validation: for SU(3) (Calabi-Yau 3-folds), h = 2 and dim(SU(3)) − h = 6, numerically confirmed on T⁶/ℤ₃.

**Lean status**: `Spectral.PhysicalSpectralGap` (28 theorems, zero axioms). `Spectral.SelbergBridge` connects the spectral gap to the mollified Dirichlet polynomial S_w(T) via the Selberg trace formula.

**Numerical observations**: The following near-identities hold to within 0.3%:

| Relation | Left side | Right side | Deviation |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| dim(G₂)/√2 ≈ π² | 9.8995 | 9.8696 | 0.30% |
| dim(K₇)×√2 ≈ π² | 9.8995 | 9.8696 | 0.30% |

These suggest a connection between the topological integer dim(G₂) = 14 and the transcendental number π². Whether this reflects deeper structure or numerical coincidence remains open.

**Universality**: The 1/H* scaling has been verified numerically across multiple G₂ manifolds with different Betti numbers. The proportionality constant depends on the metric normalization convention.

### 7.4 Continued Fraction Structure

The bare topological ratio 14/99 = dim(G₂)/H* admits a notable continued fraction representation:

$$\frac{14}{99} = [0; 7, 14] = \cfrac{1}{7 + \cfrac{1}{14}}$$

The only integers appearing are **7 = dim(K₇)** and **14 = dim(G₂)**, the two fundamental dimensions of GIFT geometry.

### 7.5 Pell Equation Structure

The spectral gap parameters satisfy a Pell equation:

$$\boxed{H^{*2} - 50 \times \dim(G_2)^2 = 1}$$

Explicitly:
$$99^2 - 50 \times 14^2 = 9801 - 9800 = 1$$

where $50 = \dim(K_7)^2 + 1 = 49 + 1$.

**Fundamental unit**: The Pell equation $x^2 - 50y^2 = 1$ has fundamental solution $(x_0, y_0) = (99, 14)$, giving:

$$\varepsilon = 7 + \sqrt{50}, \quad \varepsilon^2 = 99 + 14\sqrt{50}$$

**Continued fraction bridge**: The discriminant $\sqrt{50}$ has periodic continued fraction $\sqrt{50} = [7; \overline{14}]$ with period 1, where the partial quotients are exactly dim(K₇) = 7 and dim(G₂) = 14. Combined with the selection principle κ = π²/14 (formalized in `Spectral.SelectionPrinciple`), this provides an arithmetic link between the Pell structure and the spectral gap.

**Status**: TOPOLOGICAL (algebraic identity verified in Lean)

# Part III: K₇ Manifold Construction

## 8. Twisted Connected Sum Framework

### 8.1 TCS Construction

The twisted connected sum (TCS) construction provides the primary method for constructing compact G₂ manifolds from asymptotically cylindrical building blocks.

**Key insight**: G₂ manifolds can be built by gluing two asymptotically cylindrical (ACyl) G₂ manifolds along their cylindrical ends, with the topology controlled by a twist diffeomorphism φ.

### 8.2 Asymptotically Cylindrical G₂ Manifolds

**Definition**: A complete Riemannian 7-manifold (M, g) with G₂ holonomy is asymptotically cylindrical (ACyl) if there exists a compact subset K ⊂ M such that M \ K is diffeomorphic to (T₀, ∞) × N for some compact 6-manifold N.

### 8.3 Building Blocks (v3.3: Both Betti Numbers Derived)

For the GIFT framework, the proposed K₇ blueprint uses two specific ACyl building blocks:

**M₁: Quintic in CP⁴**
- Construction: Derived from quintic hypersurface in CP⁴
- Betti numbers: b₂(M₁) = 11, b₃(M₁) = 40
- Hodge numbers: (h¹'¹, h²'¹) = (1, 101) for the base Calabi-Yau

**M₂: Complete Intersection CI(2,2,2) in CP⁶**
- Construction: Intersection of three quadrics in CP⁶
- Betti numbers: b₂(M₂) = 10, b₃(M₂) = 37
- Hodge numbers: (h¹'¹, h²'¹) = (1, 73) for the base Calabi-Yau

| Building Block | b₂ | b₃ | Origin |
|----------------|----|----|--------|
| M₁ (Quintic) | 11 | 40 | Calabi-Yau geometry |
| M₂ (CI) | 10 | 37 | Calabi-Yau geometry |
| **K₇ (TCS)** | **21** | **77** | **Mayer-Vietoris** |

**Key result (v3.3)**: Both Betti numbers follow from the TCS formula via Mayer-Vietoris:
- b₂(K₇) = b₂(M₁) + b₂(M₂) = 11 + 10 = **21**
- b₃(K₇) = b₃(M₁) + b₃(M₂) = 40 + 37 = **77**

The building block data comes from standard Calabi-Yau geometry, and the TCS combination is derived from the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence.

**The compact manifold**:
$$K_7 = M_1 \cup_\phi M_2$$

**Global properties**:
- Compact 7-manifold (no boundary)
- G₂ holonomy: admits torsion-free G₂ metrics under Joyce's existence theorem (conditional on matching assumptions)
- Ricci-flat: Ric(g) = 0 (consequence of full G₂ holonomy)
- Euler characteristic: χ(K₇) = 0 (Poincaré duality for odd-dimensional manifolds)

**Combinatorial connections**:
- b₂ = 21 = C(7,2) = edges in complete graph K₇
- b₃ = 77 = C(7,3) + 2 × b₂ = 35 + 42

**Status**: TOPOLOGICAL (Lean 4 verified: `TCS_master_derivation`)

---

## 9. Cohomological Structure

### 9.1 Mayer-Vietoris Analysis

The Mayer-Vietoris sequence provides the primary tool for computing cohomology:

$$\cdots \to H^{k-1}(N) \xrightarrow{\delta} H^k(K_7) \xrightarrow{i^*} H^k(M_1) \oplus H^k(M_2) \xrightarrow{j^*} H^k(N) \to \cdots$$

### 9.2 Betti Number Derivation

**Result for b₂**: The sequence analysis yields:
$$b_2(K_7) = b_2(M_1) + b_2(M_2) = 11 + 10 = 21$$

**Result for b₃**: Similarly:
$$b_3(K_7) = b_3(M_1) + b_3(M_2) = 40 + 37 = 77$$

**Status**: TOPOLOGICAL (exact)

### 9.3 Complete Betti Spectrum and Poincaré Duality

For a compact G₂-holonomy 7-manifold K₇, Poincaré duality gives b_k = b_{7-k}:

| k | b_k(K₇) | Derivation |
|---|---------|------------|
| 0 | 1 | Connected |
| 1 | 0 | Simply connected (G₂ holonomy) |
| 2 | 21 | TCS: 11 + 10 |
| 3 | 77 | TCS: 40 + 37 |
| 4 | 77 | Poincaré duality: b₄ = b₃ |
| 5 | 21 | Poincaré duality: b₅ = b₂ |
| 6 | 0 | Poincaré duality: b₆ = b₁ |
| 7 | 1 | Poincaré duality: b₇ = b₀ |

**Euler characteristic**: For any compact oriented odd-dimensional manifold, χ = 0:
$$\chi(K_7) = \sum_{k=0}^{7} (-1)^k b_k = 1 - 0 + 21 - 77 + 77 - 21 + 0 - 1 = 0$$

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `euler_char_K7_is_zero`, `poincare_duality_K7`

**Cohomological sum**:
$$H^* = b_2 + b_3 + 1 = 21 + 77 + 1 = 99$$

### 9.4 The Structural Constant 42 (v3.3)

The number 42 appears throughout GIFT as a derived topological invariant:

$$42 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = p_2 \times N_{gen} \times \dim(K_7)$$

**Multiple derivations**:

| Formula | Value | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| p₂ × N_gen × dim(K₇) | 2 × 3 × 7 = 42 | Binary × generations × fiber |
| 2 × b₂ | 2 × 21 = 42 | Twice the gauge moduli |
| b₃ - C(7,3) | 77 - 35 = 42 | Global vs local 3-forms |

**Connection to b₃ decomposition**:
$$b_3 = 77 = C(7,3) + 42 = 35 + 2 \times b_2$$

The 35 local modes correspond to Λ³(ℝ⁷) fiber forms; the 42 global modes arise from the TCS structure.

**Status**: **VERIFIED (Lean 4)**: `structural_42_gift_form`, `structural_42_from_b2`

### 9.5 Third Betti Number Decomposition

The b₃ = 77 harmonic 3-forms decompose as:

$$H^3(K_7) = H^3_{\text{local}} \oplus H^3_{\text{global}}$$

| Component | Dimension | Origin |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| H³_local | 35 = C(7,3) | Λ³(ℝ⁷) fiber forms |
| H³_global | 42 = 2 × 21 | TCS global modes |

**Verification**: 35 + 42 = 77

# Part IV: Metric Structure and Verification

## 10. Structural Metric Invariants

### 10.1 Metric Invariants from Topology

The GIFT framework explores the hypothesis that metric invariants derive from fixed mathematical structure. The topological constraints serve as inputs; the specific geometry is then determined.

| Invariant | Formula | Value | Status |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| κ_T | 1/(b₃ - dim(G₂) - p₂) | 1/61 | TOPOLOGICAL |
| det(g) | (w × (rank(E₈) + w))/2⁵ | 65/32 | MODEL NORMALIZATION |

### 10.2 Torsion Magnitude κ_T = 1/61

**Derivation**:
$$\kappa_T = \frac{1}{b_3 - \dim(G_2) - p_2} = \frac{1}{77 - 14 - 2} = \frac{1}{61}$$

**Interpretation**:
- 61 = effective matter degrees of freedom
- b₃ = 77 total fermion modes
- dim(G₂) = 14 gauge symmetry constraints
- p₂ = 2 dimensional ratio dim(G₂)/dim(K₇)

**Status**: TOPOLOGICAL

### 10.3 Metric Determinant det(g) = 65/32

The metric determinant normalization admits three equivalent algebraic formulations from topological constants.

**Path 1** (pentagonal formula):
$$\det(g) = \frac{w \times (\text{rank}(E_8) + w)}{2^{w}} = \frac{5 \times 13}{32} = \frac{65}{32}$$

**Path 2** (Cohomological):
$$\det(g) = p_2 + \frac{1}{b_2 + \dim(G_2) - N_{\text{gen}}} = 2 + \frac{1}{21+14-3} = 2 + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{65}{32}$$

**Path 3** (H* formula):
$$\det(g) = \frac{H^* - b_2 - 13}{32} = \frac{99 - 21 - 13}{32} = \frac{65}{32}$$

The pentagonal index w = 5 admits three equivalent algebraic formulations from the same topological constants, suggesting structural coherence rather than independent derivation. The value det(g) = 65/32 is imposed as a model normalization (not a topological invariant).

**Numerical value**: 65/32 = 2.03125 (exact rational)

**Status**: MODEL NORMALIZATION (exact rational value, three equivalent algebraic formulations)

## 11. Formal Certification

### 11.1 The Algebraic Reference Form

The algebraic reference form in a local G₂-adapted orthonormal coframe:

$$\varphi_{\text{ref}} = c \cdot \varphi_0, \quad c = \left(\frac{65}{32}\right)^{1/14}$$
$$g_{\text{ref}} = c^2 \cdot I_7 = \left(\frac{65}{32}\right)^{1/7} \cdot I_7$$

**Important clarification**: This representation holds in a local orthonormal frame. The manifold K₇ constructed via TCS is curved and compact; "I₇" reflects the frame choice, not global flatness. The reference form φ_ref determines det(g) = 65/32; the global torsion-free solution φ_TF exists by Joyce's theorem.

| Property | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| det(g) | 65/32 | EXACT (algebraic) |
| φ_ref components | 7/35 | 20% sparsity |
| Joyce threshold | ‖T‖ < ε₀ = 0.1 | Satisfied (224× margin) |

### 11.2 Joyce Existence Theorem and Global Solutions

**Important clarification**: The reference form φ_ref = c·φ₀ is the canonical G₂ structure in a local orthonormal coframe, not a globally constant form on K₇. On a compact TCS manifold, the coframe 1-forms {eⁱ} satisfy deⁱ ≠ 0 in general, so "constant components" does not imply dφ = 0 globally.

**Actual solution structure**: The topology and geometry of K₇ impose a deformation:
$$\varphi = \varphi_{\text{ref}} + \delta\varphi$$

The torsion-free condition (dφ = 0, d*φ = 0) is a **global constraint**. Joyce's perturbation theorem guarantees existence of a torsion-free G₂ metric when the initial torsion satisfies ‖T‖ < ε₀ = 0.1. PINN validation (N=1000) confirms ‖T‖_max = 4.46 × 10⁻⁴, providing a 224× safety margin.

**Why GIFT satisfies Joyce's criterion**: The topological bound κ_T = 1/61 constrains ‖δφ‖, ensuring the manifold lies within Joyce's perturbative regime where a torsion-free solution exists.

### 11.3 Independent Numerical Validation (PINN)

A companion numerical program constructs explicit G₂ metrics on K₇ via physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The three-chart atlas (neck + two Calabi-Yau bulk regions) uses approximately 10⁶ trainable parameters in float64 precision.

**Initial validation** (Phase 2):

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| ‖T‖_max | 4.46 x 10⁻⁴ | 224x below Joyce epsilon₀ |
| ‖T‖_mean | 9.8 x 10⁻⁵ | T --> 0 confirmed |
| det(g) error | < 10⁻⁶ | Confirms 65/32 |

**G₂ metric program** (approximately 50 training versions):

**Note (February 2026)**: The holonomy scores reported in earlier versions of this document were computed before the flat-attractor discovery, which revealed that the atlas metrics had converged to near-flat solutions where all FD curvature was noise. The table below is retained for historical reference only.

| Metric | Initial (v5) | v11 (pre-flat-attractor) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| g2_self (honest holonomy) | 3.86 | 3.25 | -16% |
| V₇ projection score | 0.51 | 0.014 | -97% |
| det(g) at neck | 4.69 | 2.031 | locked at target |
| phi drift | 13.4% | 0% | controlled |

**Updated validated results (February 2026)**: Exhaustive 1D metric optimization establishes a scaling law ∇φ(L) = 1.47 × 10⁻³/L² (per fixed bulk metric G₀). Subsequent bulk metric optimization (block-diagonal rescaling of G₀) reduces this to ∇φ(L) = 8.46 × 10⁻⁴/L², a 42% improvement. The torsion decomposes into 65% t-derivative and 35% fiber-connection contributions. Spectral fingerprint [1, 10, 9, 30] at 5.8σ. Full details in the companion numerical paper [8].

A critical bug in the g₂ basis construction was discovered and corrected between versions 9 and 10: the Fano-plane heuristic does not produce correct g₂ generators. The correct g₂ subalgebra is the kernel of the Lie derivative map (Section 6.2).

**Robust statistical validation**: The det(g) = 65/32 prediction passes 8/8 independent tests (permutation, bootstrap, Bayesian posterior 76.3%, joint constraint p < 6 x 10⁻⁶).

Full details of the PINN architecture, training protocol, and version-by-version results are presented in the companion numerical paper [8].

### 11.4 Lean 4 Formalization

**Scope of verification**: The Lean formalization (core v3.3.24, 140+ files, zero `sorry`) verifies:
1. Arithmetic identities and algebraic relations between GIFT constants
2. Numerical bounds (e.g., torsion threshold)
3. G₂ differential geometry: exterior algebra Λ*(ℝ⁷), Hodge star, ψ = ⋆φ (axiom-free `Geometry` module)
4. Physical spectral gap: λ₁ = 13/99 from Berger classification (`Spectral.PhysicalSpectralGap`, 28 theorems, zero axioms)
5. Selberg bridge: trace formula connecting S_w(T) to spectral gap (`Spectral.SelbergBridge`)
6. Mollified Dirichlet polynomial S_w(T) over primes (axiom-free `MollifiedSum` module)
7. Selection principle κ = π²/14 (`Spectral.SelectionPrinciple`)

It does **not** formalize:
- Existence of K₇ as a smooth G₂ manifold
- Physical interpretation of topological invariants
- Uniqueness of the TCS construction

## 12. Analytical G₂ Metric Details

### 12.1 The Standard Form φ₀

The associative 3-form preserved by G₂ ⊂ SO(7), introduced by Harvey and Lawson (1982) in their foundational work on calibrated geometries:

$$\varphi_0 = \sum_{(i,j,k) \in \mathcal{I}} \sigma_{ijk} \, e^{ijk}$$

where:
- 𝓘 = {(0,1,2), (0,3,4), (0,5,6), (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6), (2,4,5)}
- σ = (+1, +1, +1, +1, -1, -1, -1)

### 12.2 Linear Index Representation

In the C(7,3) = 35 basis:

| Index | Triple | Sign | Index | Triple | Sign |
|-------|--------|------|-------|--------|------|
| 0 | (0,1,2) | +1 | 23 | (1,4,6) | -1 |
| 9 | (0,3,4) | +1 | 27 | (2,3,6) | -1 |
| 14 | (0,5,6) | +1 | 28 | (2,4,5) | -1 |
| 20 | (1,3,5) | +1 | | | |

All other 28 components are exactly 0.

### 12.3 Metric Derivation

From φ₀, the metric is determined via [Bryant 1987]:
$$g_{ij} \, \text{vol}_g = \frac{1}{6} \, \iota_{e_i}\varphi \wedge \iota_{e_j}\varphi \wedge \varphi$$

In an orthonormal frame adapted to φ₀, this reduces to the contraction identity φ_{ikl} φ_{jkl} = 6 δ_{ij}. For the standard φ₀: g = I₇ (identity), det(g) = 1.

Scaling φ → c·φ gives g → c²·g, hence det(g) → c¹⁴·det(g).

Setting c¹⁴ = 65/32 yields the GIFT metric.

### 12.4 Comparison: Fano Plane vs G₂ Form

| Structure | 7 Triples | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Fano lines** | (0,1,3), (1,2,4), (2,3,5), (3,4,6), (4,5,0), (5,6,1), (6,0,2) | G₂ cross-product ε_{ijk} |
| **G₂ form** | (0,1,2), (0,3,4), (0,5,6), (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6), (2,4,5) | Associative 3-form |

Both have 7 terms but different index patterns. The Fano plane defines the octonion multiplication (cross-product), while the G₂ form is the associative calibration.

### 12.5 Verification Summary

| Method | Result | Reference |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Algebraic | φ = (65/32)^{1/14} × φ₀ | This section |
| Lean 4 | `det_g_equals_target : rfl` | AnalyticalMetric.lean |
| PINN | Converges to constant form | gift_core/nn/ |
| Joyce theorem | ‖T‖ < 0.1 → exists metric (224× margin) | [Joyce 2000] |

Cross-verification between analytical and numerical methods supports internal consistency of the normalization and numerical entry into Joyce's perturbative regime (conditional on the K₇ hypothesis).
