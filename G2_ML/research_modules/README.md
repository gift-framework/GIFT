# Research Modules

This directory contains specialized research modules for G2 geometry and related mathematical frameworks.

## Contents

### meta_hodge
Advanced Hodge theory implementations and meta-level analyses for G2 manifolds. Includes computational tools for Hodge decomposition and related differential geometry structures.

### tcs_joyce
Implementation of Torelli-type theorems and Joyce's construction methods for special holonomy manifolds. Contains specialized algorithms for G2 geometry following Dominic Joyce's theoretical framework.

### variational_g2
Variational approaches to G2 geometry. Includes energy functionals, gradient flows, and optimization methods for G2 structures.

## Purpose

These modules represent exploratory and specialized research directions that complement the main G2_ML training pipeline. They are kept separate from the core training versions (1_9b, 2_0, 2_1) to maintain clarity in the repository structure.

## Integration

While these modules can be used independently, they are designed to interface with the main G2 metric learning framework when needed for advanced analyses or alternative computational approaches.
