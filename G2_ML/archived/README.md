# G2_ML Archived Versions

This folder contains archived versions from the G2_ML development history.
These versions are preserved for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Structure

### early_development/
Versions 0.1 through 0.6c and 0.9 - Initial development phase (Sept-Oct 2025).

| Version | Description |

| 0.1 | Initial prototype, feasibility proof-of-concept |
| 0.2 | Architecture refinement, 2x convergence improvement |
| 0.3 | Loss function improvements |
| 0.4 | Curriculum learning strategy (70% -> 85% success) |
| 0.5 | Preliminary b3 exploration |
| 0.6, 0.6b, 0.6c | Validation refinement iterations |
| 0.9 | Refinement attempt (superseded by 0.9a) |

### v1_iterations/
