# G2_ML v0.1 - Initial Prototype

**Status**: ⚠️ ARCHIVED
**Date**: 2025-09
**Purpose**: Initial prototype and proof-of-concept

## Features

- Basic PhiNetwork architecture for K₇ metric learning
- Initial harmonic 2-form extraction attempt
- Foundational loss functions (orthonormality, closedness)
- Proof-of-concept training loop

## Key Files

- `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Detailed technical notes
- Jupyter notebooks with initial experiments
- Python modules: early versions of G2_geometry, G2_manifold

## Status

**ARCHIVED** - Superseded by v0.7+ (production) and v0.9a+ (latest)

This version demonstrated feasibility but has been replaced by more mature implementations.

## Migration

Use **v0.9a** for current work:
```bash
cd ../0.9a/
jupyter notebook Complete_G2_Metric_Training_v0_9a.ipynb
```

See [G2_ML/STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) for current framework status.

**Version**: 0.1 (archived)
**Next**: See v0.7 or v0.9a for production code
