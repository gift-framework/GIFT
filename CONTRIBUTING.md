**Dependencies**
- Use only packages in `requirements.txt`
- Request addition of new dependencies with justification

**Verification**
- Include test cases for new functions
- Verify numerical results against analytical expressions
- Document numerical precision achieved

### Documentation

**Tone**
- Sober and humble, avoiding hype
- Speculative where appropriate
- Balanced presentation of strengths and limitations

**Formatting**
- Markdown for all documentation
- No emojis in technical documents
- Mathematical notation: `\( ... \)` inline, `\[ ... \]` display

**Citations**
- Use consistent citation format
- Include all relevant references
- Prefer peer-reviewed sources

## Examples of Contributions

### Good Contribution Examples

**Example 1: New Prediction**
```
Title: Derive axion mass from K₇ topology

Description: Using the harmonic 3-form structure from Supplement F,
I derive a prediction for axion mass: m_a = 10^-5 eV * (geometric factor).

Status: THEORETICAL (proof outline provided, full rigor in progress)

Verification: Numerical calculation agrees with formula to 10 digits.
Experimental comparison: Consistent with current bounds m_a < 10^-4 eV.
```

**Example 2: Improved Precision**
```
Title: Refine sin²θ_W calculation using two-loop corrections

Description: Include two-loop corrections in gauge coupling running,
improving sin²θ_W prediction from 0.009% to 0.003% deviation.

Impact: Strengthens agreement with experimental value.
Method: Updated equations in Supplement C.7 with full derivation.
```

### What to Avoid

**Avoid: Unsupported Claims**
```
❌ "This proves string theory is correct"
✓ "This provides evidence consistent with string-theoretic frameworks"
```

**Avoid: Hiding Limitations**
```
❌ Reporting only successful predictions
✓ Documenting both agreements and tensions with experiment
```

**Avoid: Insufficient Documentation**
```
❌ "The result is obviously true"
✓ Providing step-by-step derivation or numerical verification
```
