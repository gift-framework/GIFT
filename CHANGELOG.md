- Enhanced cross-referencing between documents
- Consistent notation across all materials
- Improved presentation of experimental comparisons

### Fixed

**Scientific Accuracy**

- Improved treatment of running coupling constants
- Enhanced error propagation in derived quantities

**Documentation**
- Fixed inconsistent file path references
- Corrected broken links in README and CITATION
- Updated Binder and Colab notebook paths
- Standardized table formats across documents

### Experimental Results

**Confirmed Predictions (< 0.1% deviation)**
- α⁻¹ = 137.036 (0.001%)
- Q_Koide = 2/3 (0.005%)
- δ_CP = 197° (0.005%)
- sin²θ_W = 0.23127 (0.009%)
- α_s(M_Z) = 0.1180 (0.08%)
- Ω_DE = ln(2) (0.10%)

**High-Precision Predictions (< 0.5%)**
- Complete neutrino mixing (all four parameters)
- Complete CKM matrix (ten elements, mean 0.11%)
- Lepton mass ratios (mean 0.12%)
- Gauge coupling unification

### Framework Statistics

- **Observables**: 34 dimensionless predictions
- **Exact relations**: 9 rigorously proven
- **Parameters**: 3 geometric (down from 19 in Standard Model)
- **Mean precision**: 0.13%
- **Documentation**: ~7000 lines across supplements

### Notes

**Theoretical Advances**
The v2.0 framework establishes several exact mathematical relations previously unavailable:
- N_gen = 3 from topological necessity (rank-Weyl structure)
- Triple origin for √17 (Higgs sector)
- Binary architecture foundation for dark energy
- McKay correspondence connection to golden ratio

**Experimental Outlook**
The framework now provides clear falsification criteria and testable predictions for upcoming experiments (Belle II, LHCb, precision neutrino measurements). The tightest constraint comes from δ_CP, where future precision measurements could decisively test the topological origin hypothesis.
